Does music move? 

Well, yes---if by "move", we meant the way that we can
indeed be *moved* by music: from table-taps to tangos to
tears. 

Or yes again---if by "music", we meant the vibrations of
sound that allow us to hear what a musician plays: from instrument
through air to ear.

But the question becomes less easy to answer, if we ask it
of "music" and "motion" in a more elementary sense. ---The
sense in which we might say, of a rhythm, that it quickens
or slows; or of a melody, that it rises or falls; or of a
harmony, that it departs or returns. (Now mention movements,
and more generally time.)
