Does music move? 

Well, yes---if by "move", we meant the way that we can
indeed be *moved* by music: from table-taps to tangos to
tears. 

Or yes again---if by "music", we meant the vibrations of
sound that allow us to hear what a musician plays: from
instrument to air to ear.

But the question becomes less easy to answer, if we ask it of "music"
and "motion" in a more elementary sense. ---The sense in which we might
say, of a rhythm, that it quickens and slows; or of a melody, that it
rises and falls; or of a harmony, that it departs and returns. And
suppose we say all this about the first movement of a symphony, not
thinking twice about calling what we hear a "movement." For we talk as
if we hear just that in the music---movement---and as if any piece of
music indeed moves itself in moving us. And how could it be otherwise?
After all, if music happens in time, and time is a medium of motion,
or at least a measure of motion, then music must indeed be a motion in
turn; and for lovers of music, among the most meaningful such motions in
their lives.

But there may be less reason to accept this conclusion than
to deny it. For the meaningfulness of music in this sense,
upon reflection, would seem to depend on the illusion of
movement rather than the reality of it, in something like
the way that a motion picture, despite its name, only seems
to move: nothing in truth but a series of photographs on a
strip of plastic. Music, too, may be nothing in truth but
the series of notes that we find indelibly and immovably
marked in a score. Once these notes are played in
succession, just as once those photographs are shown in
succession, they give us the inescapable impression of
something's moving, even though nothing is moving. No
photograph or note, after all, could be said to move itself
in the succession, or somehow fuse with the next photograph
or note to make the succession into a genuine transition.
Yet we sense transition in this succession all the same, in
what is arguably thus a mere image of motion, without a
similarly moving origin. 

The lack of motion in music more radical, since film
photographs a motion and the score (or recording) isn't photograph the
musicians moving. (They stay still.) (Maybe mention lack of rapidity.) We can reach this same conclusion about music even leaving the analogy
to motion pictures aside, by considering .
