Does music move? 

Well, yes---if by "music", we meant the
vibrations of sound that allow us to hear what a
musician plays: from instrument to air to ear.

Or yes again---if by "move", we meant the way that we
can indeed be *moved* by music: from table-taps to
tangos to tears.

But the question becomes harder to answer, if we
ask it of music and movement in a more elementary
sense. ---The sense in which we might say, of
a rhythm, that it quickens and slows; or of a
melody, that it rises and falls; or of a harmony,
that it departs and returns. And suppose we say
all this about the first movement of a symphony,
not thinking twice about calling what we hear a
"movement." For we talk as if we hear just that
in the music---movement---and as if any piece of
music indeed moves itself in moving us. And how
could it be otherwise? After all, if music happens in time,
and time is a measure of motion, then
music, it would seem, is a motion in turn; and for lovers
of music, among the most meaningful such motions
in their lives.

But then again, time may not be the only measure
of motion, at least if by "motion", we mean
*locomotion*, involving not just change in time,
but change in place. Of motion in this sense, one
measure is time, but another would seem to be
space. ---The space, for example, that measures
the rise and fall of a bird in flight. Or again,
the rise and fall of a melody. Or more generally,
the motion we hear in music, at least of any music
that involves not just beats but tones, not just
rhythm but melody and harmony. For the motion we
hear in music that includes all three elements
would seem---necessarily--- a kind of locomotion,
happening over time in a kind of space, where we
indeed hear a rising and falling, departing and
returning, from place to place, very like the
motion we might see of a bird in flight. (Start
from here. Maybe delete rest of this paragraph)
Yet to say we *hear* this motion in the case of
music is one reason to doubt that it is happening
in any *actual* space; and thus one reason to
doubt that the motion we hear in music is real.
For in what kind of actual space could there be a
motion, like the rise and fall of a melody, that
we can hear, but never see? Where the distance
made apparent in sight, and the space so revealed
by sight, are no intrinsic part of the perception
of motion in question?

And there are several related reasons for doubting that the
motion we hear in music is real.  Another
reason for doubt is that there seems to be nothing
we can identify in such a motion, for all its
resemblance to the flight of a bird, like the bird
itself. (Use this at end, nothing like bird, or other
things, or transition, thus nothing like space.)

in which a bird, for
example, And we seem to invoke a sense of space
in talking about the motion, for example, of the
rising and falling of a melody.

Transition paragraph: mention that Zuckerkandl
discusses this in Sound and Symbol even if not
in Sense of Music, and it strikes me as an
important issue, perhaps the most significant
issue, in understanding music, and its place in
the liberal arts. Slavery and free. (Make new
paragraph here: about how music also happens in
space as a movement; music is not simply change.
Perhaps use motion picture paragraph to indicate
difference in the illusoriness of music and
illusoriness of motion pictures. Organize replies
to evident illusoriness of motion in terms of
motion being an illusion, being an appearance, and
being a reality, in rough correspondence to the
distinction made in Plato's Sophist. Also mention
music as a kind of liberal art.)

(Rough organization: music as illusion, but problem
with difference between illusion and appearance, such
as difference between movies and paintings. Thus music
as appearance, but problem with unexamined assumptions
about motion. Music as reality.)

(End with showing, how through compound ratio, time
is not simply one-dimensional, or even an added
dimension.)

But there may be less reason to accept this
conclusion than to deny it; and to wonder, then,
how meaningful music finally is. For the meaning
of music in this sense, upon reflection, would
seem to depend on the illusion of movement rather
than the reality of it, in something like the way
that a motion picture, despite its name, only
seems to move, being nothing in truth but a series
of photographs, or frames, on a strip of plastic.
Music, too, may be nothing in truth but the series
of notes that we find indelibly and immovably
marked in a score. Once these notes are played
in succession, just as once those frames are
shown in succession, they give us the inescapable
impression of something's moving, even though
nothing is moving. No frame or note, after all,
could be said to move itself in the succession,
or somehow fuse with the next frame or note to
render that succession a genuine transition. Yet we
sense transition in the succession all the same,
in what is then a mere image of motion, without a
similarly moving origin.

And the absence of actual motion in music would
seem still more radical, if we now *contrast*
the notes that compose it with the frames of a
motion picture. For those frames, at least in the
usual case, are of a scene in which the actors
really move, taken and projected rapidly enough to
reproduce that real motion upon a screen, so far
as the eye can tell. But there is no such scene of
real motion that the notes of music could be said
to record and reproduce for the ear. And the scene
of real motion closest to the music we hear---the
musicians playing it---is all but motionless
compared to the music being played, as the players
stay seated in their chairs, for example, while
the sound of Beethoven's *Eroica* surges forth.
Indeed, it would seem necessary for the notes
in a piece of music to be *unlike* the frames
in a motion picture, if we are to hear movement
in their succession, at least the movement we
identify as music. For the succession should not
happen rapidly enough to blur the distinction
between notes, lest the music vanish in a siren
of noise; and the notes themselves should refer
only, or at least principally, to one another
in that succession, rather than to any scene
beyond, lest the music vanish again, in a kind of
picture-painting.

But we could also leave any comparison to motion
pictures aside, and simply contrast the most
salient features in our experience of motion
otherwise, with their seeming absence in our
experience of music. Suppose I see a bird in
flight, rising and falling in the sky. I can
identify the thing moving as the bird, and other
things---such as the mountain behind it, or the
ground beneath it, or even the clouds nearby
it---as unmoving relative to the bird. I can also
suppose that the bird's movement is a matter not
simply of being in different spots of the sky at
different times, but of being carried from spot
to spot---continuously---by its flying. Yet if I
now hear a melody rise and fall, none of these
features of motion are straightforwardly apparent.
I just identified the thing moving as the melody;
but what I more strictly hear, if a motion in any
sense, is a motion from one note of the melody to
the next. What I called the "melody", then, is
no already-formed object, like the flying bird,
that similarly rises and falls. Nor is there any
unmoving such object to be heard near the melody,
like the mountain, ground, or clouds to be seen
near the bird, relative to which the melody could
be said to move. We might try to identify such
an object in each note of the melody, perhaps by
analogy to each spot in the sky; but then it seems
we are left with nothing to identify as rising or
falling in the melody itself. And what exactly
is *moving* in the melody, through each unmoving
note in turn, becomes even harder to say. In this
case we also confront the difference between the
bird's being carried from spot to spot in the
sky continuously, and the melody's being carried
from note to note discretely, without having to
travel audibly through every note between.  But it then becomes
hard even to say how there is indeed a moving through
each note in turn, much less what it is that might be
moving. (Put Zuckerkandl quote here.) 

And even this much analysis of the
difference between our sense of motion generally and our
sense of motion in music depends on our taking the notes of
music not simply as sounds, occupying particular moments of
time, but also as tones, occupying particular places in
space---in this case, the places in space that allow us to
say the melody rises and falls. But what kind of places
in space are this? What kind of space is this? And *where* is
it? Surely not where the singer of the melody is, or as if the
melody could rise and fall in the same sky inhabited by the
bird. But if the space in which music moves is not the same
space in which we encounter motion otherwise, then why
credit our talk of the motion in music with any but a
metaphorical sense? it looks
as if we are speaking only metaphorically in saying that
music moves.
