### Does Music Move?

Does music move?

Well, yes---if by "music", we meant the
vibrations of sound that allow us to hear what a
musician plays: from instrument to air to ear.

Or yes again---if by "move", we meant the way
that we can indeed be *moved* by music: from
table-taps to tangos to tears.

But the question becomes harder to answer, if we
ask it of music and movement in a more elementary
sense. ---The sense in which we might say, of
a rhythm, that it quickens and slows; or of a
melody, that it rises and falls; or of a harmony,
that it departs and returns. And suppose we say
all this about the first movement of a symphony,
not thinking twice about calling what we hear a
"movement". For we talk as if we hear just that
in the music---movement---and as if any piece of
music indeed moves itself in moving us, carrying
us from moment to moment, place to place.

And the talk has a point. For if we didn't
hear music move, would we hear music at all?
Without movement, music would seem no more than
a succession of sounds, the next following the
last in time. To hear music in this succession, then,
means hearing the next sound follow the last
not just in time, but in space. ---The kind of
space that allows what we hear to quicken 
and slow as a rhythm, or rise and fall as a melody, or depart
and return as a harmony. Or to move, in sum, as a piece
of music. 

But there is also a problem with this sort of
talk, despite its point. And it is this problem
that I wish to discuss in my lecture tonight. I
have accordingly divided the lecture into two
parts. In the [first part][part one], I will
explain what the problem is. And in the [second
part][part two], I will explain why I take the
problem to be important---even for those of us
with little interest in music. But since I assume
rather more interest in music in my account of
the problem itself, and that account is rather
long, I will say this much now
about my sense of its importance, in case it
helps anyone sit through the first part of my
lecture more expectantly, or at least patiently.
While I present this specifically as a problem
in our experience of music, I take it to be a
problem, more generally, in our experience of the
world. And at stake in the problem, on that level,
is the prospect of our freedom in the world.
So understood---or at least as I will want to
understand it---the problem thus poses a challenge
to liberal education---indeed, to the very idea
of liberal education. But more on that in [Part
Two][part two].

#### I. The nature of the problem. [part one]

So what is the problem with our talking as if
music moved? The problem, in a word, is with
*space*: the space, that is, in which music must
move, if it does move. For this space makes
something close to complete sense on the one hand,
yet something closer to nonsense on the other. I
begin, then, with a [rather long account][sense]
of what I mean by the complete sense it makes,
before offering a [briefer account][nonsense] of
the nonsense it makes.

##### The sense it makes. [sense]
To see the sense it makes, we can start by
comparing the movement we hear in music, with
the variation we hear in sounds more generally.
As examples, consider the difference between the
rise and fall of a melody---such as "Twinkle,
Twinkle, Little Star"---and the rise and fall of
a police or fire siren. Both involve a change in
pitch over time. But in the melody, we sense a
change of place *within* this change in pitch,
as if having caused it. To hear the beginning of
"Twinkle Twinkle", for example, is not simply to
hear, say, middle C followed by the G a fifth
above; it is also to hear, within this change of
pitch, a movement---indeed, a leap---from the
first degree of a melodic scale to the fifth, or
otherwise put, from the ˆ1 tone to the ˆ5 tone.
When the siren rises and falls, by contrast, we
hear no such change of place *within* the change
in pitch, even if we can see, or infer, the change
of place *behind* it, in the police car or fire
engine that produced it. Nor could we directly map
the siren's change in pitch onto the places in a
melodic scale, as if to treat its rise and fall as
a proto-melody; for the siren's change in pitch
is continuous, while the places in the scale are
discrete.

Of course, we may not know the names for those
places, or even have any conception of a musical
scale, to identify the change of place we hear
in the melody. But this possibility is only more
evidence of how much sense the space of musical
movement can make, in what we might call its *own*
terms, without the need for any theory beyond the
music to justify it. And it reflects a striking
fact about what it means to understand music. For
we can develop an altogether discerning musical
ear, while remaining all but illiterate about
what we hear. What is more, becoming literate
about what we hear, by studying some music theory,
underlines the sense it makes even without such a
theory. For this theory comprehends a topography in
music---as I will now try to show---that is more
discovered than invented, and in the discovery,
more inhabited than observed. And indeed, my
conclusion will be that it is because we
finally seem to *inhabit* what we hear, in hearing
music move, that the space in which it moves makes
complete sense. The completeness in this sense of
musical space, has to do with the experience of
inhabitance.

To begin to see what I mean by this, let us take
a closer look at the terms I used for the melody
in the example above. Consider, first, the way I
identified its first two pitches by note---middle
C and the G a fifth above. This identification
depends on two topographical facts, as we might
call them, in our perception of notes, even
outside a musical context. The first such fact
is that we hear a difference in pitch, whereby
one note is distinguished from another, as a
difference in relative place, one note sounding
higher, the other note lower. This perception also
proves to be transitive: if one note sounds higher
than a second, and the second higher than a third,
then the first will also sound higher than the
third. Thus, our perception of pitch difference
gives every note its own position along an axis
of height. Hence my talk of the G a fifth *above*
middle C, to distinguish it, say, from the G a
fourth below.

Then there is my reference just now to the
two G's on either side of middle C, along with
my reference to middle C itself, in order to
distinguish that C from every other C there is.
This repetition of note letters reflects the
second topographical fact in our perception of
notes: the phenomenon of the octave. For while we
distinguish notes by their difference in pitch,
this difference reaches a kind of limit at the
interval called the "octave." At this interval,
the notes sound the same, despite their difference
in pitch, and are thus given the same letter as
name. Exactly *why* we hear this sameness is hard
to say: Aristotle attributed it to a perception
of the whole number ratio 2:1; while Victor
Zuckerkandl deems it a miracle. But however it
happens, mathematically or miraculously, the
sameness we hear in notes, once their difference
in pitch reaches the octave, in effect contains
that difference. If we pass beyond it, we
don't encounter new notes, but only new instances,
higher or lower, of old notes. The octave thus
turns the axis of height, along which notes are
arranged by pitch, into a kind of circumference,
which continues to trace their increase or
decrease in pitch without end, but always to the
same place again.

Yet this image, of notes now arranged into a
circumference by the phenomenon of the octave,
is not yet an image of the space in which music
moves. For it only comprehends the change of
pitch involved, as we might conceive this change
to carry us *along* the circumference. But in
hearing a melody, to recall, we hear not only a
change in pitch, but a change of place *within*
the change in pitch. If we pressed the image of
our circumference, as I am now about to do, it
would be as if we heard the notes of a melody from
*inside* this circumference, and were carried from
note to note not *along* it, in a mere change of
pitch, but *across* it, in a change of place. So
understood, the circumference becomes an image
of the space in which music moves, by becoming
an image of our inhabitance of that space, when
we hear music move. 

But to see this more clearly, consider again the
beginning of "Twinkle, Twinkle" as I described
this above. As I said, we hear a leap from the ˆ1
tone to the ˆ5 tone *within* the change of pitch
from middle C to G. This description reflects
another pair of topographical facts in our
perception of notes, once we hear these notes in
a musical context. The first such fact is that we
hear movement from one note to another, without
having to hear any notes between. In the case of
"Twinkle, Twinkle", then, we hear an initial leap
from the ˆ1 tone to the ˆ5, without having to
hear the ˆ2,ˆ3, or ˆ4 tones first. And indeed to
hear them first would not complete the leap, as
if to fill it in, but rather transform the leap
into a climb, which again we would hear, without
needing to hear any of the potential notes between
ˆ1 and ˆ2, or ˆ2 and ˆ3, and so on---of which
there are indefinitely many in a continuum of
pitch. Why this is a fact of musical perception
may be as hard to explain as the octave. But as a
phenomenon, it seems to involve a sense of being
*oriented* in the movement we hear from note to
note. It is as if we faced the note we were moving
to, and reached it as a goal, without needing to
take account of any in-between notes silently
passed along the way.

The sense of being oriented among notes is even
clearer in the second topographical fact, which
involves our perception of notes in at least
those musical contexts we call *tonal*. And it is
this fact that forced me to shift from letters
to numbers, when identifying the initial leap
in "Twinkle, Twinkle", from what I called the
ˆ1 tone to what I called the ˆ5 tone. For in
tonal musical contexts---and the name "tonal" is
derived from this fact---we will hear one note as
a kind of center, which *orients* us with respect
to the other notes we hear, as if to provide a
place from which to face them. The central note
is accordingly assigned the number 1 in analysis,
and the other notes assigned other numbers in
reference to 1. Again, why we are able to hear a
certain note as a center for other notes is hard
to say. But the phenomenon, as Zuckerkandl would
remind us, is tellingly dynamic, in an orientation
more felt than seen. We hear the central note as
central, that is, by sensing a stability in it
relative to the other notes, as if it provided a
place to to face them as a center of gravity. This
second topographical fact so informs the first:
for we then move from note to note as if under
the influence of a gravitational pull, requiring
effort to overcome, in a deepened sense of having
faced the note being moved to, and successfully
reaching that note as a goal.

Or again, to revert to the geometric image of this
inhabitance as I described it above, we hear the
movement in a melody, as in music more generally, 
as if we were *inside* a circumference of notes
arranged by pitch and bounded by the octave. 
For once we hear one note in the melody as
central, especially if we hear it as a center 
of gravity, it is as if that note
has been projected *inside* this circumference
from its place along it, allowing us to move from
note to note not simply *along* the circumference,
through every note between, but now 
also *across* the circumference, through 
the one note inside it, in being always guided by that note,
as a center of orientation.   

This is perhaps as far as the circumference image
could, or should, be pressed. But again, it gives
a geometric form to the complete sense made by the
space in which music moves. And this is the sense in which we
*inhabit* that space in hearing it. To be sure,
the development of this sense, as shown by the
specifically *tonal* context in which we hear
one note of a melody as central, depends on the
like development of a specific form of musical
art---the art to which we owe the music of the
West. But there would be no such art to develop,
unless the result made a difference to what we
could hear; and in this case, to what we could
inhabit in what we hear. 

And much of Western music's development can be
explained as a kind of deduction from the features
of a space we inhabit. I spell this thought out
briefly, in one example, for those familiar with
this development. If we truly inhabited the
space in which we heard music move, it seems we
should not be simply fixed, transcendentally as
it were, at a single center of orientation. We
should rather be able move that center, carrying
it with us from place to place. And move it we
can---once Western music developed the device of
modulation, to carry us from key to key. We might
also expect the movement of that center to happen
along an axis of depth, away and back, not just
to distinguish it from the up-and-down movement
between notes along an axis of height, but also
from a sense of perspective, which implicitly
belongs to our sense of orientation when we
inhabit a space. And so we do move away and
back---once Western music developed the harmony
out of polyphony that modulation relies upon. We
might further expect the movement of the center
to clarify our sense, as I described this above,
of the gravitational forces at work in such a
space. And clarified they are---once the use of
modulation effectively reduced the modes of chant
to the major-minor scale. We might finally expect the
movement of the center to deepen our sense that
we inhabit *one* space, which *contains* the
places moved between, rather than many spaces
distinguished and divided by those places. And
deepened it is---once the use of modulation forced
upon the tuning of a scale the leveling of equal
temperament, restricting the notes of *any* key
to the notes in *every* key, and thereby placing
"the whole of tonal space," as Roger Scruton has
strikingly put it, "within reach of its every
occupant."[^fn-1]

[^fn-1]: Roger Scruton, *The Aesthetics of Music*, p. 244.

Along with this kind of deduction of Western
music's development from the features of a
space we inhabit, comes a plausible if simple
measure of the greatness in a musical work. The
greater it is, the deeper it carries us into the
space in which music moves. And by that measure
of inhabitance, the best demonstration of the
complete sense this space can make, is found not
in the account I have just given of it, but rather
in those masterpieces of Western music---such as
Beethoven's *Eroica*---where we feel this space
explored to a kind of limit, in the conquest of
it.

***

But so much, then, for *my* account of the kind of sense
this space seems to make. It is time to show why it also
makes a kind of nonsense, despite
my account, and all the masterpieces
of Western music notwithstanding.    

##### The nonsense it makes. [nonsense] 

To see this, we can start by comparing the
movement we hear in music, with the movement of
things we observe more generally. As examples,
we can use the rise and fall of a melody like
"Twinkle, Twinkle" again, but now compare it to
the rise and fall of our hand, as if to follow
it, or conduct it. In the melody, we again
hear a change of place *within* the change in
pitch. And this is analogous to the change of
place we observe in the motion of our hand. But
there is also a difference. For as I discussed
earlier, we hear the movement from note to note
in the melody, such as the leap from ˆ1 to ˆ5 in
"Twinkle, Twinkle," without having to hear any
notes between. The motion happens, so we might
say, *discretely*. By contrast, we see the hand's
movement from place to place happen continuously,
through *all* the places between. And this
continuity would seem a necessary feature of its
movement. For if our hand got from place to place
discretely, like the melody did, then it would
look to us as if it reached each place not by
motion, but rather by magic. Or at least we'd be
tempted to think there was something in the space
where the motion occurred, beyond just space, that
was interrupting the motion, by disrupting the
continuity that the motion would otherwise have.
But this is one reason, then, to think that there
isn't really a space for the melody to move in.
For if there were, 
then it would allow the melody to move in it continuously
rather than discretely.

But this points to a still deeper difference
between the movement of the melody and the
movement of our hand in following it. For the
melody is *composed* of the notes it seems to
move between, while our hand is not so composed
of the places it moves between. And this at once
explains why the melody has to move discretely.
It has to move discretely, because it has *to
become* what it is, which means passing through
only those notes that thereby compose it, and that
distinguish it, thus composed, from any other
melody. But then the melody can only *be* what
it is by becoming so, over an interval of time.
And in this sense, the melody is temporal rather
than spatial. But this is then another reason, and
more decisive reason, to think that there isn't
really a space for the melody to move in. For if
there were, then it would allow the melody to be
spatial rather than temporal; which is to say, it
would allow the melody to *be* what it is in space
without having to become so, and to remain what it
is, unchanged, through every change of place.

But let me try to put this point still another
way, since I think it captures the nonsense 
more clearly. The melody is not a spatial whole,
like our hand, that space can then contain, at
every moment of its motion. The melody is rather
a temporal whole, that space cannot then contain,
at *any* moment of its motion. For at any moment,
at most, space will contain only one note of
the melody. But this means, speaking strictly
if nonsensically, that there is no melody to be
heard, in the space we hear it move. When I say
that we hear a leap in "Twinkle, Twinkle" from the 
ˆ1 tone to the ˆ5 tone, there is nothing to hear,
nothing audible, making the leap. But how,
in that case, could there *be* any leap to hear?
And what could be making it? 

But this is only the start of the nonsense. For
it might seem as if the conclusion to reach from
this analysis is modest. We have an observed
sense of the space in which motion ordinarily
occurs, that we cannot apply to the movement of
music. For applying it makes the music vanish,
and thus makes nonsense of the movement we hear
in the music. But what follows from this? Perhaps
only that the space in which music moves is not
ordinary, but extraordinary. And this is one
way to understand my earlier defense of the
sense---the complete sense---made by the space in
which music moves. For as I accounted for it, this
was not an observed sense of space, but rather
an inhabited sense. So if there *is* a space
for music to move in, which makes sense of the
movement, then this space, and its relation to
motion, will have to be understood from within, as
a matter of inhabitance, rather than from without,
as a matter of observation.

Well, fair enough. But this makes the nonsense
of such a space even easier to defend. For what
is it, finally, that makes an inhabited sense
of space extraordinary rather than ordinary?
One answer---and it is the answer given, for
example, by Heidegger when he speaks of our
being-in-the-world---is that an inhabited sense of
space is extraordinary, in not stopping short of
totality. True, we may suppose there are places
in the world we will never encounter, or even
places beyond the world we could never reach,
or only hope to reach in a kind of afterlife
and transcendence of our mortality. There may
even be places wholly unknown to God. Still, our very
sense of such places, like our awareness
of the Being of beings, shows how our horizon
of inhabitance is all-encompassing, even if our
horizon of comprehension falls forever short of
it. (Now move on to link between totality and
unity.)

As powerful a sense of inhabitance in Beethoven, it is still
parasitic on the sense of inhabitance we have of which
Beethoven is only a part. 
<!-- the hand's
movement. if we are to say that
our hand has indeed moved from place to place. it is this continuity
in the change of place that the change of place happening in space,
the change in pitch happening in time. And we
can take this to be analogous to the change of
place that happens in space, within the change
motion of our hand. One difference between these
movements, which I already discussed on the side
of the melody, is that



Yet for all its resemblance to this flight, the
motion we hear in music is different. And the
difference suggests something illusory about the
space of this motion, and thus about the motion
itself. In the rise and fall of a melody, for
example, what I hear is a motion from one note
of the melody to the next, as if from one place
to the next. is is then hard to say what exactly
is *moving* in the melody itself, through each
of its unmoving notes in turn. There is nothing
to be heard , is hard to say. that corresponds
to the bird in its flight? And this flight is
continuous in being motion: the bird is not
simply found in different places at different
times; it is also seen to move continuously from
place to place, through every place between. But
the melody, by contrast, is carried from note to
note discretely, without having to travel audibly
through every note between. But then it becomes
hard even to say how there is a *moving* through
each note in turn, much less what it *is* that
might be moving. And for that matter, in what
sense is there indeed a *moving* through each
note in turn, that corresponds to the bird's
flight through each place in turn? We can trace
the rise and fall of a melody with our hand---as
if to conduct it---yet there is nothing that
corresponds to our hand in the melody we hear, or
more generally, to a conductor in the movement
he conducts, or to a dancer in the music she
dances to. (Arguably to fill in what isn't there.
Because it moves us, it doesn't move itself.)

It becomes so hard to say, in fact, that the
reality of this motion is more readily denied
has been more often denied than asserted in the
history of musical aesthetics. And it is easier,
in fact, to suppose that the reason we can hear
a melody rise and fall, or music more generally
move from place to place, without having to be
an already-formed object moving relative to any
unmoving such objects and through every place is
because the space of this motion is illusory, and
the motion in turn unreal. Something happening in
time, that only seems to be happening in space.

no space in which motion can occur.)

itself. (Use this at end, nothing like bird, or
other things, or transition, thus nothing like
space.)

Yet to say we *hear* this motion in the case of
music is one reason to doubt that it is happening
in any *actual* space; and thus one reason to
doubt that the motion we hear in music is real.
For in what kind of actual space could there be a
motion, like the rise and fall of a melody, that
we can hear, but never see? Where the distance
made apparent in sight, and the space so revealed
by sight, are no intrinsic part of the perception
of motion in question?

invoke a sense of space in talking about the

a melody.-->

Then, in moving to issue with space, make it one
of inhabitance, where we seem in two worlds at
once.

is that we will hear
one note of in a melody
as a kind of center, which *orients* us with
respect to the other notes in the melody, as if
to provide a place from which to face them. The
central note is accordingly assigned the number
1 for the purposes of melodic analysis, and the
other notes assigned other numbers---2, 3, and so
on---making implicit reference to 1. The two facts seem to be related: we
hear melody as central, again as if from a place
to face the other notes, we also move that way
between notes in the melody, as if woves us from
one note to another, on the circumference I just
described, by putting us, as it were, *inside* the
circumference, not by carrying us *along* it, in
a mere change of pitch, but rather *across* it,
in a change of place. , and across it by being
put inside the circumference, in what is then an
image of inhabitance. To see this, consider again
the beginning of "Twinkle, Twinkle" as I described
this above, where we hear a leap from the ˆ1 tone
to the ˆ5 tone *within* the change of pitch from
middle C to G. The shift from letters to numbers
in our classification of notes We classify notes
this way by number, not merely by letter, to
reflect yet another pair of topographical facts
in our perception of notes, both involving a
sense of orientation, once we hear these notes in
a musical context like a melody. The first such
fact is that we hear one note in a melody as a
kind of center, which *orients* us with respect to
the other notes in the melody, as if to provide a
place from which to face them. The central note is
accordingly assigned the number 1 for the purposes
of melodic analysis, and the other notes assigned
other numbers---2, 3, and so on---making implicit
reference to 1. The second topographical fact is
that we hear movement from one note to another
without having to hear any notes between. We hear
a leap from the ˆ1 tone to the ˆ5 in "Twinkle,
Twinkle," for example, without having to hear
the ˆ2,ˆ3, or ˆ4 tones first; and indeed to hear
them first would turn the leap into a climb. This
second fact, like the first, involves a sense of
orientation produced by musical contexts like
melodies produce: so just as we then hear one note
in the melody as central, again as if from a place
to face the other notes, so we also move that way
between notes, as if we faced the note we were
moving to, and then reached it as a goal, without
needing to take account of any in-between notes
silently passed along the way. The two facts seem
to be related: we hear melody as central, again as
if from a place to face the other notes, we also
move that way between notes in the melody, as if
we

the orientation
provided by that note, across the circumference
and through that note, from one note to another
subsequently made, will *not* then be made *along* the
circumference, or from one note to another through every
note between.  The movement will rather be made through none
of the notes between in being made *across* the
circumference, through its central point, in a geometric
reflection of the way we seem to inhabit musical space in
hearing music move, from one note to the other not through
every note between, but rather through the orientation
provided by a central such note.

This is perhaps as far as this image of a circumference
should be pressed for the purposes , but that we
find ourselves inside of, A geometric image of inhabitance. Inhabitance, perspective,
mobility, even equal temperament. Make sure to discuss
these in terms of the experience that makes them viable
developments in the history of music.
(Keep facing language. Leap as if
making it ourselves, rather than watching it from
the side. Relates to Zuckerkandl point, that the
orientation comes with gravity, stability.) In
this example, the central note is middle C, thus
given the number 1. hat central notein a melodic
scale by number recall the melodic scale I invoked
to describe the initial change of place in the
melody:

it.)
(Both in terms of center, and in the
sense the move from note to note isn't through
every note between, like the siren.) (Mention
sense of leaping) ccording to the degrees in a
melodic scale. Same place again can be heard
as a center, as if projected to a point inside
the circumference, and which orients us with
respect to that circumference. as if this place
were projected to a center. .(Mention specific
example of middle C and G.) This introduces ,
gain, within the change of pitch that would carry
us along this circumference, we hear a change of
place, For again, we hearOnce the notes on that
circumference are selected and arrangedFor in
reaching the same place againFor as indicated by
a melodic scale, reaching the same place again
means hearing it as a center that organizes the
notes in between, as if as a projection from this
place. And Zuckerkandl points out, our perception
of this center is not static or merely spatial,
but dynamic, as if the center possossed gravity.
And the center can change, it is mobile; while
harmony contributes perspective. Then there is
equal temperament, which in Scruton's words There
is then (revise from here: longest distance return
to same, so circumferential, then talk about being
centered and feeling weight or gravity, then
move on the center moving through modulation and
harmony giving depth, perhaps equal temperment) a
topography so real as to be inhabited.

Our sense of the place we inhabit is not that it is merely
a part of some larger whole, but rather than it is finally
that whole.

But what kind of space could this be, that allows
music to move? And where is it, in relation to
the space we ordinarily inhabit? When we find
ourselves in a symphony hall, for example, with
musicians seated in their chairs, yet hear
the sounds of Beethoven's *Eroica*
surging forth, where has the music taken us? Out of the
symphony hall? Deeper into the symphony hall? Are we in our
heads? has the music taken us? and hear
Beethoven's *Eroica* surge forth even as the
musicians playing it are comparatively motionless
in their chairs, ,In paragraph where space doesn't make sense, point out
that where is space, if outside of us? 
which means (talk about occupying a place) that
notes are not simply arranged by pitch in a
relative position of lower and higher; they also
form extremitiesgives notes a sense of place
beyond higher and lower, Thus the sameness we
hear giving to notes an octave apart a deeper
sense of place that comprehends their relative
position of higher or lower. ; while still hearing
a difference in pitch. Indeed, this difference is
maximal rather than minimal: it is not the pitches
we can barely distinguish as lower or higher to
one another that prove to sound the same in this
sense; but rather the pitches we most easily so
distinguish. So the sameness we hear establishes
a sense of place that comprehends the higher
and lower; beyond higher and lower; different
pitches can occupy this place in sounding the
same, despite their distance from one another
in pitch. Moreover, this distance---to which we
give the name "octave"---turns out to be maximal
rather than minimal; the sense of place is more
like a circumference that contains the pitches of
a melody. In a still-more important feature of
this perception, the sameness we hear in these
pitches corresponds to a difference between them
that is maximal rather than minimal, measured
by the octave. So the sense of place is of a
circumference rather than a latitude or longitude.

  And since the sameness we hear is that
different pitches can occupy, beyond the
positions that distinguishes them by pitch.

determines., which pitches can occupy rather than
merely determine. can be occupied by different
pitches. the sameness we hear comes with an
implicit sense of place, occupied by entities
otherwise separated by pitch. of sameness
seems to be a sense of place, occupied by many
pitches indefinitely many pitches. at a kind of
extremity of distance, measured by the octave,
from one such pitch to the next, And the sense
of place comes with a kind of circumference,
which contains every other pitch that doesn't so
sound the same, since the place is occupied by
pitches that are otherwise most different rather
than least different, in a kind of containing of
all the pitches between, the sense of place is a
sense of circumference.

account for a topography of perception---and
more generally, the possibility that we can
have an altogether discerning musical ear while
remaining all but illiterate about what we
hear, yet--is one of the only more evidence for
how much sense the space of musical motion can
make. For the point of musical theory, in this
respect, is not to construct that space but
rather to illuminate it, in something like the
way a forest is illuminated once you know the
names of the trees in it, giving us the words and
concepts to say we already hear, when we hear
music in a succession of sounds.(revise from

in question (mention usual way of dividing

that suggests a circumference to space, then by

pitches in question, at least by ear, under the
description that nowadays distinguishes them,
in terms of the frequency at which a wavelength
vibrates. For frequency in this sense is able to
define a pitch by abstracting from any sense of
its place. But for those few of us with perfect
pitch, even the recognition of pitch will come
with an implicit sense of place, according to
where we hear middle C, followed by the G a

This distinguishes the movement in music from
the movement in mere sound, There is no such
change in place that we hear in a mere sound,
like a siren, whose rise and fall involves only
a change in pitch over time. Unlike the rise and
fall of a siren, for example, where we hear a
continuous change of pitch over time, the rise
and fall of melodythis movement as a change in
place. (Say what places are.) And this change in
place distinguishes music from mere sound, which
changes in time. , we could say that when we hear
music move---at least of any kind that includes
not just rhythm, but melody and harmony---we
hear the movement as a change in place, and we
can be more or less exact about the places in
question. So, we don't hear a melody just rise
and fall; we hear it rise and fall in moving
from one tone to another in a scale of such
tones---say, from the 1 tone up to the 5, then
down again to the 1. Similarly, we don't hear
the harmony supporting that melody just depart
and return; we hear it depart and return by
moving from one chord to another in a scale of
such chords---say, from tonic to dominant and
back again to tonic. It is this exactness about
the space in which music moves that allows it
to be composed and encoded on a musical score,
even though the score itself is soundless and
motionless. It is also this exactness that allows
music to be analyzed and studied, rather than
merely heard and appreciated. And one way of
understanding the history of music, at least in
the West, is as a progress in such exactness And
that music happens in so articulable a space is
what seems to distinguishes it from mere sound,
which happens, by contrast, in time rather than
space. it is the space of music in this sense
that distinguishes it from mere sound, which by
contrast happens only in time.

between the so-called degrees of a melodic or
harmonic scale. (Put the next bit later, to
suggest music is an illusion.)

So again, on the one hand, the motion we hear in
music would seem to be real enough to happen in
a completely accountable kind of space. Yet on
the other hand, (motionless score; motionless
orchestra; and that space otherwise allows
for continuity of motion and identity through
time precluded by musical space; then maybe

supplying it, that music moves in moving us.)

(What do previous paragraphs show about the
reality of space.) The fact that music can be so
immediately distinguished from sound

And how could it be otherwise? After all, if
music happens in time, and time is a measure of
motion, then music, it would seem, is a motion
in turn; and for lovers of music, among the most
meaningful such motions in their lives.

not just in time, but in space. The motion is
a form of *locomotion*, or motion from place
to place. But then again, time is not the only
measure of motion, at least if by "motion", we
mean *locomotion*, or a motion from place to
place. Of motion in this sense, one measure is
time, but another is space. ---The space, for
example, in which a bird rises and falls in
flight. Or the space, by seeming resemblance,
in which a melody rises and falls; and more
generally, in which music---at least of any
kind that involves not just beats but tones,
not just rhythm but melody and harmony---indeed
moves, from place to place, rising and falling,
departing and returning, very like the motion of
a bird in flight.

Transition paragraph: mention that Zuckerkandl
discusses this in Sound and Symbol even if not
in Sense of Music, and it strikes me as an
important issue, perhaps the most significant
issue, in understanding music, and its place in
the liberal arts. Slavery and free. (Make new
paragraph here: about how music also happens in
space as a movement; music is not simply change.
Perhaps use motion picture paragraph to indicate
difference in the illusoriness of music and
illusoriness of motion pictures. Organize replies
to evident illusoriness of motion in terms of
motion being an illusion, being an appearance,
and being a reality, in rough correspondence to
the distinction made in Plato's Sophist. Also
mention music as a kind of liberal art.)

(Rough organization: music as illusion, (and
being serious about music means being serious
about the possibility that it may be a waste
of time). but problem with difference between
illusion and appearance, such as difference
between movies and paintings. Thus music
as appearance, but problem with unexamined
assumptions about motion. Music as reality.)

(End with showing, how through compound ratio,
time is not simply one-dimensional, or even an
added dimension.)

But there may be less reason to accept this
conclusion than to deny it; and to wonder, then,
how meaningful music finally is. For the meaning
of music in this sense, upon reflection, would
seem to depend on the illusion of movement rather
than the reality of it, in something like the
way that a motion picture, despite its name,
only seems to move, being nothing in truth but
a series of photographs, or frames, on a strip
of plastic. Music, too, may be nothing in truth
but the series of notes that we find indelibly
and immovably marked in a score. Once these
notes are played in succession, just as once
those frames are shown in succession, they give
us the inescapable impression of something's
moving, even though nothing is moving. No frame
or note, after all, could be said to move itself
in the succession, or somehow fuse with the
next frame or note to render that succession a
genuine transition. Yet we sense transition in
the succession all the same, in what is then a
mere image of motion, without a similarly moving
origin.

And the absence of actual motion in music would
seem still more radical, if we now *contrast* the
notes that compose it with the frames of a motion
picture. For those frames, at least in the usual
case, are of a scene in which the actors really
move, taken and projected rapidly enough to
reproduce that real motion upon a screen, so far
as the eye can tell. But there is no such scene
of real motion that the notes of music could be
said to record and reproduce for the ear. And
the scene of real motion closest to the music
we hear---the musicians playing it---is all but
motionless compared to the music being played,
as the players stay seated in their chairs, for
example, while the sound of Beethoven's *Eroica*
surges forth. Indeed, it would seem necessary
for the notes in a piece of music to be *unlike*
the frames in a motion picture, if we are to
hear movement in their succession, at least the
movement we identify as music. For the succession
should not happen rapidly enough to blur the
distinction between notes, lest the music vanish
in a siren of noise; and the notes themselves
should refer only, or at least principally, to
one another in that succession, rather than to
any scene beyond, lest the music vanish again, in
a kind of picture-painting.

And even this much analysis of the difference
between our sense of motion generally and our
sense of motion in music depends on our taking the
notes of music not simply as sounds, occupying
particular moments of time, but also as tones,
occupying particular places in space---in this
case, the places in space that allow us to say the
melody rises and falls. But what kind of places in
space are this? What kind of space is this? And
*where* is it? Surely not where the singer of the
melody is, or as if the melody could rise and fall
in the same sky inhabited by the bird. But if the
space in which music moves is not the same space
in which we encounter motion otherwise, then why
credit our talk of the motion in music with any
but a metaphorical sense? it looks as if we are
speaking only metaphorically in saying that music
moves.-->
