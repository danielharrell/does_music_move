### Does Music Move?

Does music move?

Well, yes---if by "music", we meant the
vibrations of sound that allow us to hear what a
musician plays: from instrument to air to ear.

Or yes again---if by "move", we meant the way
that we can indeed be *moved* by music: from
table-taps to tangos to tears.

But the question becomes harder to answer, if we
ask it of music and movement in a more elementary
sense. ---The sense in which we might say, of
a rhythm, that it quickens and slows; or of a
melody, that it rises and falls; or of a harmony,
that it departs and returns. And suppose we say
all this about the first movement of a symphony,
not thinking twice about calling what we hear a
"movement". For we talk as if we hear just that
in the music---movement---and as if any piece of
music indeed moves itself in moving us.

And the talk has a point. For if we didn't hear
music move, it seems we wouldn't hear music at
all. Instead, we would hear simply a succession
of sounds, the next following the last in time.
But it is only when we hear the next sound following
the last in space that we hear music in the
succession. ---The space that allows it to
quicken and slow, rise and fall, depart and
return, as if note followed note, pitch after
pitch, moment by moment, in a movement from place
to place.

But what kind of space could this be, that allows
music to move? It is this question, and the
difficulty of answering it, that indicates a
problem with the way we talk about the movement
in music, despite its point. And it is this 
problem that I wish to discuss
in my lecture tonight. I have divided the lecture,
accordingly, into two parts. In the first part, 
I will explain the problem in terms that make the
most sense to me, of why it *is* a problem. And in
the second part, I will explain why I take the problem
to be important---even for those
of us with little interest in music. 

##### Part One

The problem, in a nutshell, is with making sense
of the *space* in which music moves. For this
space makes something close to complete sense on
the one hand, yet something close to nonsense
on the other. We can see the sense it makes by
comparing the movement we hear in music, with
the variation we hear in sounds more generally.
As examples, consider the difference between the
rise and fall of a melody---such as "Twinkle,
Twinkle, Little Star"---and the rise and fall of
a police or fire siren. Both involve a change in
pitch over time. But in the melody, we sense a
change of place *within* this change in pitch,
as if having caused it. To hear the beginning of
"Twinkle Twinkle", then, is not simply to hear,
say, middle C followed by the G a fifth above;
it is also to hear, within this change of pitch,
a movement---indeed, a leap---from the first
degree of a melodic scale to the fifth, or, in an
alternative formulation, from the ˆ1 tone to the
ˆ5. When the siren rises and falls, by contrast,
we hear no such change of place *within* the
change in pitch, even if we can see, or infer,
the change of place *behind* it, in the police
car or fire engine that produced it. Nor could we
directly map the siren's change in pitch onto the
places in a melodic scale, as if to treat its rise
and fall as a proto-melody; for the siren's change
in pitch is continuous, while the places in the
scale are discrete.

Of course, we may not know the names for those
places in a scale, or even have any explicit conception of a
musical scale, to identify the change of place we hear
in the melody. But this possibility is only more
evidence of how much sense the space of musical
movement can make, without the need for any
theory to justify it. And it reflects the
striking fact that we can develop an altogether
discerning musical ear while remaining all but
illiterate about what we hear. What is more, becoming
literate about what we hear, by studying the
theory we have for the space of musical movement,
underlines the sense it makes even without
such a theory. For this theory depends on a
topography more discovered than invented, and in
the discovery, more inhabited than observed.

What I mean by this inhabitance can be clarified
if we take a closer look at the terms I used
for the melody in the example above. Even the
way I identified its first two pitches by
note---middle C and the G a fifth above---depends
on a classification informed by two topographical
facts, as we might call them, in our perception of
notes, even outside a musical context. The first
such fact is that we hear a difference in pitch, whereby
one note is distinguished from another, as a
difference in relative place, one note sounding
higher, the other note lower. This perception also
proves to be transitive: if one note sounds higher
than a second, and the second higher than a third,
then the first will also sound higher than the
third. Thus, our perception of pitch difference
gives every note its own position along an axis
of height. Hence my talk of the G a fifth *above*
middle C, to distinguish it, say, from the G a
fourth below.

Then there is my reference just now to the two
G's on either side of middle C, along with
my reference to middle C itself, in order to
distinguish that C from every other C there is.
This repetition of note letters reflects the
second topographical fact in our perception of
notes: the phenomenon of the octave. For while
we distinguish notes by their difference in
pitch, this difference reaches a kind of limit
at the distance or interval called the "octave."
At this interval, the notes sound the same
despite their difference in pitch, and are thus
given the same letter as name. Exactly *why* we
hear this sameness is hard to say: Aristotle
attributed it to a perception of the whole number
ratio 2:1; while Victor Zuckerkandl deems it a
miracle. But however it happens, mathematically
or miraculously, the sameness we hear in notes,
once their difference in pitch reaches the octave,
effectively bounds that difference. For beyond
it, we don't encounter new notes, but only new
instances, higher or lower, of old notes. The octave
thus turns the axis of
height, along which notes are arranged by pitch, into a kind
of circumference, which continues to trace their 
increase or decrease in pitch without end, but always
to the same place again.  

But this circumference of notes is not yet an
image of the space in which music moves. For as
described, it only comprehends the change of pitch
involved, as we might conceive this change to
carry us *along* such a circumference. But again,
in hearing a melody such as "Twinkle, Twinkle",
we not only hear a change in pitch; we hear a
change of place *within* the change in pitch. And
this reflects how the melody puts us *inside*
the circumference I just described, and carries
us from note to note not *along* it, in a mere
change of pitch, but *across* it, 
in a change of place. To see this, consider again
the beginning of "Twinkle, Twinkle" as I described
this above, where we hear a leap from the ˆ1 tone
to the ˆ5 tone *within* the change of pitch from
middle C to G. The shift from letters to numbers
in our classification of notes We classify notes
this way by number, not merely by letter, to
reflect yet another pair of topographical facts
in our perception of notes, both involving a
sense of orientation, once we hear these notes
in a musical context like a melody. The first
such fact is that we hear one note in a melody
as a kind of center, which *orients* us with
respect to the other notes in the melody, as if
to provide a place from which to face them. The
central note is accordingly assigned the number
1 for the purposes of melodic analysis, and the
other notes assigned other numbers---2, 3, and so
on---making implicit reference to 1. The second
topographical fact is that we hear movement from
one note to another without having to hear any
notes between. We hear a leap from the ˆ1 tone
to the ˆ5 in "Twinkle, Twinkle," for example,
without having to hear the ˆ2,ˆ3, or ˆ4 tones
first; and indeed to hear them first would turn
the leap into a climb. This second fact, like the
first, involves a sense of orientation produced by
musical contexts like melodies produce: so just as
we then hear one note in the melody as central,
again as if from a place to face the other notes,
so we also move that way between notes, as if we
faced the note we were moving to, and then reached
it as a goal, without needing to take account
of any in-between notes silently passed along
the way. The two facts seem to be related: we
hear melody as central, again as if from a place
to face the other notes, we also move that way
between notes in the melody, as if woves us from
one note to another, on the circumference I just
described, by putting us, as it were, *inside* the
circumference, not by carrying us *along* it, in
a mere change of pitch, but rather *across* it,
in a change of place. , and across it by being
put inside the circumference, in what is then an
image of inhabitance. To see this, consider again
the beginning of "Twinkle, Twinkle" as I described
this above, where we hear a leap from the ˆ1 tone
to the ˆ5 tone *within* the change of pitch from
middle C to G. The shift from letters to numbers
in our classification of notes We classify notes
this way by number, not merely by letter, to
reflect yet another pair of topographical facts
in our perception of notes, both involving a
sense of orientation, once we hear these notes in
a musical context like a melody. The first such
fact is that we hear one note in a melody as a
kind of center, which *orients* us with respect to
the other notes in the melody, as if to provide a
place from which to face them. The central note is
accordingly assigned the number 1 for the purposes
of melodic analysis, and the other notes assigned
other numbers---2, 3, and so on---making implicit
reference to 1. The second topographical fact is
that we hear movement from one note to another
without having to hear any notes between. We hear
a leap from the ˆ1 tone to the ˆ5 in "Twinkle,
Twinkle," for example, without having to hear
the ˆ2,ˆ3, or ˆ4 tones first; and indeed to hear
them first would turn the leap into a climb. This
second fact, like the first, involves a sense of
orientation produced by musical contexts like
melodies produce: so just as we then hear one note
in the melody as central, again as if from a place
to face the other notes, so we also move that way
between notes, as if we faced the note we were
moving to, and then reached it as a goal, without
needing to take account of any in-between notes
silently passed along the way. The two facts seem
to be related: we hear melody as central, again as
if from a place to face the other notes, we also
move that way between notes in the melody, as if
we

But these two facts show why hearing a melody puts us, as it
were, *inside* the circumference of notes I described above,
and carries us *across* it in a change of place, rather than
*along* it in a mere change of pitch. The central note
of the melody corresponds to a note on the circumference
that is projected inside it in being central; and any
movement between notes, since this is guided by the
orientation provided the central note, will so be made
through that note, and thus *across* the circumference,
rather than merely *along* the circumference and thereby
through every note between.  the orientation
provided by that note, across the circumference
and through that note, from one note to another
subsequently made, will *not* then be made *along* the
circumference, or from one note to another through every
note between.  The movement will rather be made through none
of the notes between in being made *across* the
circumference, through its central point, in a geometric
reflection of the way we seem to inhabit musical space in
hearing music move, from one note to the other not through
every note between, but rather through the orientation
provided by a central such note.

This is perhaps as far as this image of a circumference
should be pressed for the purposes , but that we
find ourselves inside of, A geometric image of inhabitance. Inhabitance, perspective,
mobility, even equal temperament. Make sure to discuss
these in terms of the experience that makes them viable
developments in the history of music.
(Keep facing language. Leap as if
making it ourselves, rather than watching it from
the side. Relates to Zuckerkandl point, that the
orientation comes with gravity, stability.) In
this example, the central note is middle C, thus

scale by number recall the melodic scale I invoked
to describe the initial change of place in the
melody:

it.)

melodic scale. Same place again can be heard
as a center, as if projected to a point inside
the circumference, and which orients us with
respect to that circumference. as if this place
were projected to a center. .(Mention specific
example of middle C and G.) This introduces ,
gain, within the change of pitch that would carry
us along this circumference, we hear a change of
place, For again, we hearOnce the notes on that
circumference are selected and arrangedFor in
reaching the same place againFor as indicated by
a melodic scale, reaching the same place again
means hearing it as a center that organizes the
notes in between, as if as a projection from this
place. And Zuckerkandl points out, our perception
of this center is not static or merely spatial,
but dynamic, as if the center possossed gravity.
And the center can change, it is mobile; while
harmony contributes perspective. Then there is
equal temperament, which in Scruton's words There
is then (revise from here: longest distance return
to same, so circumferential, then talk about being
centered and feeling weight or gravity, then
move on the center moving through modulation and
harmony giving depth, perhaps equal temperment) a
topography so real as to be inhabited.

In paragraph where space doesn't make sense, point out
that where is space, if outside of us? 
which means (talk about occupying a place) that
notes are not simply arranged by pitch in a
relative position of lower and higher; they also
form extremitiesgives notes a sense of place
beyond higher and lower, Thus the sameness we
hear giving to notes an octave apart a deeper
sense of place that comprehends their relative
position of higher or lower. ; while still hearing
a difference in pitch. Indeed, this difference is
maximal rather than minimal: it is not the pitches
we can barely distinguish as lower or higher to
one another that prove to sound the same in this
sense; but rather the pitches we most easily so
distinguish. So the sameness we hear establishes
a sense of place that comprehends the higher
and lower; beyond higher and lower; different
pitches can occupy this place in sounding the
same, despite their distance from one another
in pitch. Moreover, this distance---to which we
give the name "octave"---turns out to be maximal
rather than minimal; the sense of place is more
like a circumference that contains the pitches of
a melody. In a still-more important feature of
this perception, the sameness we hear in these
pitches corresponds to a difference between them
that is maximal rather than minimal, measured
by the octave. So the sense of place is of a
circumference rather than a latitude or longitude.

  And since the sameness we hear is that
different pitches can occupy, beyond the
positions that distinguishes them by pitch.
the position that their difference in pitch
determines., which pitches can occupy rather than
merely determine. can be occupied by different
pitches. the sameness we hear comes with an
implicit sense of place, occupied by entities
otherwise separated by pitch. of sameness
seems to be a sense of place, occupied by many
pitches indefinitely many pitches. at a kind of
extremity of distance, measured by the octave,
from one such pitch to the next, And the sense
of place comes with a kind of circumference,
which contains every other pitch that doesn't so
sound the same, since the place is occupied by
pitches that are otherwise most different rather
than least different, in a kind of containing of
all the pitches between, the sense of place is a
sense of circumference.

 This fact of musical perception gives an
implicit sense o. and to which we thus give the

the point of musical theory in this sense is to
account for a topography of perception---and
more generally, the possibility that we can
have an altogether discerning musical ear while
remaining all but illiterate about what we
hear, yet--is one of the only more evidence for
how much sense the space of musical motion can
make. For the point of musical theory, in this
respect, is not to construct that space but
rather to illuminate it, in something like the
way a forest is illuminated once you know the
names of the trees in it, giving us the words and
concepts to say we already hear, when we hear
music in a succession of sounds.(revise from
here) to have established a more or less complete

in question (mention usual way of dividing
pitch by places, then by scale in recurrence
that suggests a circumference to space, then by
stability, home-location, that suggests a gravity
and center, as if we inhabited it. Also mention
modulation.) we almost surely can't identify the
pitches in question, at least by ear, under the
description that nowadays distinguishes them,
in terms of the frequency at which a wavelength
vibrates. For frequency in this sense is able to
define a pitch by abstracting from any sense of
its place. But for those few of us with perfect
pitch, even the recognition of pitch will come
with an implicit sense of place, according to
where we hear middle C, followed by the G a
fifth above . And in hearing pitches at the
frequencies, the pitches at frequencies of
identifying even just the pitches of the melody
will be to identify the pitches of the melody,
for example, as middle C, And when we identify

This distinguishes the movement in music from
the movement in mere sound, There is no such
change in place that we hear in a mere sound,
like a siren, whose rise and fall involves only
a change in pitch over time. Unlike the rise and
fall of a siren, for example, where we hear a
continuous change of pitch over time, the rise
and fall of melodythis movement as a change in
place. (Say what places are.) And this change in
place distinguishes music from mere sound, which
changes in time. , we could say that when we hear
music move---at least of any kind that includes
not just rhythm, but melody and harmony---we
hear the movement as a change in place, and we
can be more or less exact about the places in
question. So, we don't hear a melody just rise
and fall; we hear it rise and fall in moving
from one tone to another in a scale of such
tones---say, from the 1 tone up to the 5, then
down again to the 1. Similarly, we don't hear
the harmony supporting that melody just depart
and return; we hear it depart and return by
moving from one chord to another in a scale of
such chords---say, from tonic to dominant and
back again to tonic. It is this exactness about
the space in which music moves that allows it
to be composed and encoded on a musical score,
even though the score itself is soundless and
motionless. It is also this exactness that allows
music to be analyzed and studied, rather than
merely heard and appreciated. And one way of
understanding the history of music, at least in
the West, is as a progress in such exactness And
that music happens in so articulable a space is
what seems to distinguishes it from mere sound,
which happens, by contrast, in time rather than
space. it is the space of music in this sense
that distinguishes it from mere sound, which by
contrast happens only in time.

between the so-called degrees of a melodic or
harmonic scale. (Put the next bit later, to
suggest music is an illusion.)

So again, on the one hand, the motion we hear in
music would seem to be real enough to happen in
a completely accountable kind of space. Yet on
the other hand, (motionless score; motionless
orchestra; and that space otherwise allows
for continuity of motion and identity through
time precluded by musical space; then maybe
mention hand, not following the motion but
supplying it, that music moves in moving us.)
other difficulties). . articulated kind of space.
(What do previous paragraphs show about the
reality of space.) The fact that music can be so
immediately distinguished from sound

And how could it be otherwise? After all, if
music happens in time, and time is a measure of
motion, then music, it would seem, is a motion
in turn; and for lovers of music, among the most
meaningful such motions in their lives.

(Put weirdness below) Space weird (symphony
seated in chairs), but real enough to involve
literacy, and what distinguishes music from mere
sound. (Space differentiated enough to the music
not just in time, but in a kind of space. change
not just in time, but in space. The motion is
a form of *locomotion*, or motion from place
to place. But then again, time is not the only
measure of motion, at least if by "motion", we
mean *locomotion*, or a motion from place to
place. Of motion in this sense, one measure is
time, but another is space. ---The space, for
example, in which a bird rises and falls in
flight. Or the space, by seeming resemblance,
in which a melody rises and falls; and more
generally, in which music---at least of any
kind that involves not just beats but tones,
not just rhythm but melody and harmony---indeed
moves, from place to place, rising and falling,
departing and returning, very like the motion of
a bird in flight.

Yet for all its resemblance to this flight, the
motion we hear in music is different. And the
difference suggests something illusory about the
space of this motion, and thus about the motion
itself. In the rise and fall of a melody, for
example, what I hear is a motion from one note
of the melody to the next, as if from one place
to the next. is is then hard to say what exactly
is *moving* in the melody itself, through each
of its unmoving notes in turn. There is nothing
to be heard , is hard to say. that corresponds
to the bird in its flight? And this flight is
continuous in being motion: the bird is not
simply found in different places at different
times; it is also seen to move continuously from
place to place, through every place between. But
the melody, by contrast, is carried from note to
note discretely, without having to travel audibly
through every note between. But then it becomes
hard even to say how there is a *moving* through
each note in turn, much less what it *is* that
might be moving. And for that matter, in what
sense is there indeed a *moving* through each
note in turn, that corresponds to the bird's
flight through each place in turn? We can trace
the rise and fall of a melody with our hand---as
if to conduct it---yet there is nothing that
corresponds to our hand in the melody we hear, or
more generally, to a conductor in the movement
he conducts, or to a dancer in the music she
dances to. (Arguably to fill in what isn't there.
Because it moves us, it doesn't move itself.)

It becomes so hard to say, in fact, that the
reality of this motion is more readily denied
has been more often denied than asserted in the
history of musical aesthetics. And it is easier,
in fact, to suppose that the reason we can hear
a melody rise and fall, or music more generally
move from place to place, without having to be
an already-formed object moving relative to any
unmoving such objects and through every place is
because the space of this motion is illusory, and
the motion in turn unreal. Something happening in
time, that only seems to be happening in space.

no space in which motion can occur.)

itself. (Use this at end, nothing like bird, or
other things, or transition, thus nothing like
space.)

Yet to say we *hear* this motion in the case of
music is one reason to doubt that it is happening
in any *actual* space; and thus one reason to
doubt that the motion we hear in music is real.
For in what kind of actual space could there be a
motion, like the rise and fall of a melody, that
we can hear, but never see? Where the distance
made apparent in sight, and the space so revealed
by sight, are no intrinsic part of the perception
of motion in question?

in which a bird, for example, And we seem to
invoke a sense of space in talking about the
motion, for example, of the rising and falling of
a melody.

Transition paragraph: mention that Zuckerkandl
discusses this in Sound and Symbol even if not
in Sense of Music, and it strikes me as an
important issue, perhaps the most significant
issue, in understanding music, and its place in
the liberal arts. Slavery and free. (Make new
paragraph here: about how music also happens in
space as a movement; music is not simply change.
Perhaps use motion picture paragraph to indicate
difference in the illusoriness of music and
illusoriness of motion pictures. Organize replies
to evident illusoriness of motion in terms of
motion being an illusion, being an appearance,
and being a reality, in rough correspondence to
the distinction made in Plato's Sophist. Also
mention music as a kind of liberal art.)

(Rough organization: music as illusion, (and
being serious about music means being serious
about the possibility that it may be a waste
of time). but problem with difference between
illusion and appearance, such as difference
between movies and paintings. Thus music
as appearance, but problem with unexamined
assumptions about motion. Music as reality.)

(End with showing, how through compound ratio,
time is not simply one-dimensional, or even an
added dimension.)

But there may be less reason to accept this
conclusion than to deny it; and to wonder, then,
how meaningful music finally is. For the meaning
of music in this sense, upon reflection, would
seem to depend on the illusion of movement rather
than the reality of it, in something like the
way that a motion picture, despite its name,
only seems to move, being nothing in truth but
a series of photographs, or frames, on a strip
of plastic. Music, too, may be nothing in truth
but the series of notes that we find indelibly
and immovably marked in a score. Once these
notes are played in succession, just as once
those frames are shown in succession, they give
us the inescapable impression of something's
moving, even though nothing is moving. No frame
or note, after all, could be said to move itself
in the succession, or somehow fuse with the
next frame or note to render that succession a
genuine transition. Yet we sense transition in
the succession all the same, in what is then a
mere image of motion, without a similarly moving
origin.

And the absence of actual motion in music would
seem still more radical, if we now *contrast* the
notes that compose it with the frames of a motion
picture. For those frames, at least in the usual
case, are of a scene in which the actors really
move, taken and projected rapidly enough to
reproduce that real motion upon a screen, so far
as the eye can tell. But there is no such scene
of real motion that the notes of music could be
said to record and reproduce for the ear. And
the scene of real motion closest to the music
we hear---the musicians playing it---is all but
motionless compared to the music being played,
as the players stay seated in their chairs, for
example, while the sound of Beethoven's *Eroica*
surges forth. Indeed, it would seem necessary
for the notes in a piece of music to be *unlike*
the frames in a motion picture, if we are to
hear movement in their succession, at least the
movement we identify as music. For the succession
should not happen rapidly enough to blur the
distinction between notes, lest the music vanish
in a siren of noise; and the notes themselves
should refer only, or at least principally, to
one another in that succession, rather than to
any scene beyond, lest the music vanish again, in
a kind of picture-painting.

And even this much analysis of the difference
between our sense of motion generally and our
sense of motion in music depends on our taking the
notes of music not simply as sounds, occupying
particular moments of time, but also as tones,
occupying particular places in space---in this
case, the places in space that allow us to say the
melody rises and falls. But what kind of places in
space are this? What kind of space is this? And
*where* is it? Surely not where the singer of the
melody is, or as if the melody could rise and fall
in the same sky inhabited by the bird. But if the
space in which music moves is not the same space
in which we encounter motion otherwise, then why
credit our talk of the motion in music with any
but a metaphorical sense? it looks as if we are
speaking only metaphorically in saying that music
moves.
