### Does Music Move?

Does music move? 

Well, yes---if by "move", we meant the way that we can
indeed be *moved* by music: from table-taps to tangos to
tears. 

Or yes again---if by "music", we meant the vibrations of
sound that allow us to hear what a musician plays: from instrument
through air to ear.

But the question becomes less easy to answer, if we ask it
of "music" and "motion" in a more elementary sense. ---The
sense in which we might say, of a rhythm, that it quickens
and slows; or of a melody, that it rises and falls; or of a
harmony, that it departs and returns. And suppose we say all
this about the first movement of a symphony, not thinking
twice about calling what we hear a "movement." For we talk
as if we hear just that in the music---movement---and as if
any piece of music indeed moves itself in moving us.  And
how could it be otherwise? After all, if music happens in
time, and time is a medium of motion, or at least a measure
of motion, then music must indeed be a motion; and for
lovers of music, one of the most meaningful such motions in
their lives.
