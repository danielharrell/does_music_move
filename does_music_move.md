Does music move? 

Well, yes---if by "move", we meant the way that we
can indeed be *moved* by music: from table-taps to
tangos to tears.

Or yes again---if by "music", we meant the
vibrations of sound that allow us to hear what a
musician plays: from instrument to air to ear.

But the question becomes less easy to answer, if
we ask it of "music" and "movement" in a more
elementary sense. ---The sense in which we might
say, of a rhythm, that it quickens or slows; of
a melody, that it rises and falls; of a harmony,
that it departs and returns. And suppose we say
all this about the first movement of a symphony,
not thinking twice about calling what we hear a
"movement." For we talk as if we hear just that
in the music---movement---and as if any piece of
music indeed moves itself in moving us. And how
could it be otherwise? After all, if time is the
medium of motion, and music happens in time, then
music must be a motion; and for lovers of music,
among the most meaningful such motions in their
lives.

But there may be less reason to accept this
conclusion than to deny it. For the meaningfulness
of music in this sense, upon reflection, would
seem to depend on the illusion of movement rather
than the reality of it, in something like the way
that a motion picture, despite its name, only
seems to move, being nothing in truth but a series
of photographs, or frames, on a strip of plastic.
Music, too, may be nothing in truth but the series
of notes that we find indelibly and immovably
marked in a score. Once these notes are played
in succession, just as once those frames are
shown in succession, they give us the inescapable
impression of something's moving, even though
nothing is moving. No frame or note, after all,
could be said to move itself in the succession,
or somehow fuse with the next frame or note to
render the succession a genuine transition. Yet we
sense transition in this succession all the same,
in what is then a mere image of motion, without a
similarly moving origin.

But the absence of actual motion in music would
seem still more radical, if we now contrast the
notes that compose it with the frames of a
motion picture. For those frames, at least in
the usual case, are of a scene in which the actors
really move, taken and projected rapidly enough to
reproduce that real motion upon a screen, so far
as the eye can tell. But there is no such scene
of real motion that the notes of music could be
said to record and reproduce for the ear. And the scene of
real motion closest to the music we hear---the
musicians playing it---is all but motionless
compared to the music being played, as the players
stay seated in their chairs, for example, while
the sound of Beethoven's *Eroica* surges forth. Indeed, it
would seem necessary for the notes in a piece
of music to be *unlike* the frames in a
motion picture, if we are to hear movement in their
succession, at least the movement we identify as
music. For the succession should not happen
rapidly enough to blur the distinction between
notes, lest the music vanish in a siren of
noise; and the notes themselves should refer only,
or at least principally, to one another in that
succession, rather than to any scene
beyond, lest the music vanish again, in a kind of
picture-painting.

kseem like a continuously varying sound, cause a
draw the following contrast with motion pictures.
For the series, since film photographs a motion
and the score (or recording) isn't photograph
the musicians moving. (They stay still.) (Maybe
mention lack of rapidity.) We can reach this same
conclusion about music even leaving the analogy to
motion pictures aside, by considering .
