Does music move? 

Well, yes---if by "music", we meant the
vibrations of sound that allow us to hear what a
musician plays: from instrument to air to ear.

Or yes again---if by "move", we meant the way that we
can indeed be *moved* by music: from table-taps to
tangos to tears.

But the question becomes harder to answer, if we
ask it of music and movement in a more elementary
sense. ---The sense in which we might say, of
a rhythm, that it quickens and slows; or of a
melody, that it rises and falls; or of a harmony,
that it departs and returns. And suppose we say
all this about the first movement of a symphony,
not thinking twice about calling what we hear a
"movement." For we talk as if we hear just that
in the music---movement---and as if any piece of
music indeed moves itself in moving us. 

There is, however, a problem with this sort of talk.
And I would like to begin my lecture by outlining 
this problem, before going on to say why I find the
problem important, even for those of us with 
little interest in music otherwise. 

On the one hand, when we hear music move, we hear
it move not just in time but in space, as a form
of *locomotion*, or motion from place to place.
And it is this change in place that distinguishes
music from mere sounds, which change only in time.
When hearing a police siren, for example, we
hear a change of pitch and volume over time, but
nothing changing its place in the sound like the
police car producing that sound, as it gets closer
and further away. But this is precisely what we
hear in music---for example, in hearing a (melody) symphony being
carried to a culminating crescendo and then falling back
in retreat. In this case we hear a change of pitch and volume over
time that involves and even reflects a 
change in place. , as the symphony, say, is carried
to a crescendo, say, that reflects a seeming
change of place,when hearing a change of pitch
and volume ; instead, we simply hear a change of
the siren's pitch and volume over time. can hear
a change in pitch and volume, as the police car
gets closer and further away, but we don't hear;
but what we don't hear in the siren is any changes
its pitch and volume but we don't hear the siren
change its placea siren, for example, to hear
something that has a beginning and end in time, it
is this that distinguishes music from mere sound.
which makes music different from mere sound. .
Generally speaking, sounds have beginnings and
ends in time, without any interest in music. And
how could it be otherwise? After all, if music
happens in time, and time is a measure of motion,
then music, it would seem, is a motion in turn;
and for lovers of music, among the most meaningful
such motions in their lives.

But then again, time is not the only measure
of motion, at least if by "motion", we mean
*locomotion*, or a motion from place to place. Of
motion in this sense, one measure is time, but
another is space. ---The space, for example, in
which a bird rises and falls in flight. Or the
space, by seeming resemblance, in which a melody
rises and falls; and more generally, in which
music---at least of any kind that involves not just
beats but tones, not just rhythm but melody and
harmony---indeed moves, from place to place, rising
and falling, departing and returning, very like
the motion of a bird in flight.

Yet for all its resemblance to this flight, the
motion we hear in music is different.  And the
difference suggests something illusory
about the space of this motion, and thus about
the motion itself. 
In the rise and fall of a melody, for example,
what I hear is a motion from one note of the
melody to the next, as if from one place to the
next. is is then hard to say what exactly is
*moving* in the melody itself, through each of its
unmoving notes in turn. There is nothing to be
heard , is hard to say. that corresponds to the
bird in its flight? And this flight is continuous
in being motion: the bird is not simply found in
different places at different times; it is also
seen to move continuously from place to place,
through every place between. But the melody, by
contrast, is carried from note to note discretely,
without having to travel audibly through every
note between. But then it becomes hard even to
say how there is a *moving* through each note
in turn, much less what it *is* that might be
moving. And for that matter, in what sense is
there indeed a *moving* through each note in turn,
that corresponds to the bird's flight through
each place in turn? We can trace the rise and
fall of a melody with our hand---as if to conduct
it---yet there is nothing that corresponds to our
hand in the melody we hear, or more generally, to
a conductor in the movement he conducts, or to a
dancer in the music she dances to. (Arguably to
fill in what isn't there. Because it moves us, it
doesn't move itself.)

It becomes so hard to say, in fact, that the
reality of this motion is more readily denied
has been more often denied than asserted in the
history of musical aesthetics. And it is easier,
in fact, to suppose that the reason we can hear
a melody rise and fall, or music more generally
move from place to place, without having to be
an already-formed object moving relative to any
unmoving such objects and through every place is
because the space of this motion is illusory, and
the motion in turn unreal. Something happening in
time, that only seems to be happening in space.

(Put Zuckerkandl quote here. All but tones, thus, no
space in which motion can occur.) 

itself. (Use this at end, nothing like bird, or other
things, or transition, thus nothing like space.)

Yet to say we *hear* this motion in the case of
music is one reason to doubt that it is happening
in any *actual* space; and thus one reason to
doubt that the motion we hear in music is real.
For in what kind of actual space could there be a
motion, like the rise and fall of a melody, that
we can hear, but never see? Where the distance
made apparent in sight, and the space so revealed
by sight, are no intrinsic part of the perception
of motion in question?

in which a bird, for
example, And we seem to invoke a sense of space
in talking about the motion, for example, of the
rising and falling of a melody.

Transition paragraph: mention that Zuckerkandl
discusses this in Sound and Symbol even if not
in Sense of Music, and it strikes me as an
important issue, perhaps the most significant
issue, in understanding music, and its place in
the liberal arts. Slavery and free. (Make new
paragraph here: about how music also happens in
space as a movement; music is not simply change.
Perhaps use motion picture paragraph to indicate
difference in the illusoriness of music and
illusoriness of motion pictures. Organize replies
to evident illusoriness of motion in terms of
motion being an illusion, being an appearance, and
being a reality, in rough correspondence to the
distinction made in Plato's Sophist. Also mention
music as a kind of liberal art.)

(Rough organization: music as illusion, but problem
with difference between illusion and appearance, such
as difference between movies and paintings. Thus music
as appearance, but problem with unexamined assumptions
about motion. Music as reality.)

(End with showing, how through compound ratio, time
is not simply one-dimensional, or even an added
dimension.)

But there may be less reason to accept this
conclusion than to deny it; and to wonder, then,
how meaningful music finally is. For the meaning
of music in this sense, upon reflection, would
seem to depend on the illusion of movement rather
than the reality of it, in something like the way
that a motion picture, despite its name, only
seems to move, being nothing in truth but a series
of photographs, or frames, on a strip of plastic.
Music, too, may be nothing in truth but the series
of notes that we find indelibly and immovably
marked in a score. Once these notes are played
in succession, just as once those frames are
shown in succession, they give us the inescapable
impression of something's moving, even though
nothing is moving. No frame or note, after all,
could be said to move itself in the succession,
or somehow fuse with the next frame or note to
render that succession a genuine transition. Yet we
sense transition in the succession all the same,
in what is then a mere image of motion, without a
similarly moving origin.

And the absence of actual motion in music would
seem still more radical, if we now *contrast*
the notes that compose it with the frames of a
motion picture. For those frames, at least in the
usual case, are of a scene in which the actors
really move, taken and projected rapidly enough to
reproduce that real motion upon a screen, so far
as the eye can tell. But there is no such scene of
real motion that the notes of music could be said
to record and reproduce for the ear. And the scene
of real motion closest to the music we hear---the
musicians playing it---is all but motionless
compared to the music being played, as the players
stay seated in their chairs, for example, while
the sound of Beethoven's *Eroica* surges forth.
Indeed, it would seem necessary for the notes
in a piece of music to be *unlike* the frames
in a motion picture, if we are to hear movement
in their succession, at least the movement we
identify as music. For the succession should not
happen rapidly enough to blur the distinction
between notes, lest the music vanish in a siren
of noise; and the notes themselves should refer
only, or at least principally, to one another
in that succession, rather than to any scene
beyond, lest the music vanish again, in a kind of
picture-painting.

And even this much analysis of the
difference between our sense of motion generally and our
sense of motion in music depends on our taking the notes of
music not simply as sounds, occupying particular moments of
time, but also as tones, occupying particular places in
space---in this case, the places in space that allow us to
say the melody rises and falls. But what kind of places
in space are this? What kind of space is this? And *where* is
it? Surely not where the singer of the melody is, or as if the
melody could rise and fall in the same sky inhabited by the
bird. But if the space in which music moves is not the same
space in which we encounter motion otherwise, then why
credit our talk of the motion in music with any but a
metaphorical sense? it looks
as if we are speaking only metaphorically in saying that
music moves.
