### Does Music Move?
Does music move?

Well, yes---if by "music", we meant the
vibrations of sound that allow us to hear what a
musician plays: from instrument to air to ear.

Or yes again---if by "move", we meant the way
we can indeed be *moved* by music: from
table-taps to tangos to tears.

But the question becomes harder to answer, if we
ask it of music and movement in a more elementary
sense. ---The sense in which we might say, of
a rhythm, that it quickens and slows; or of a
melody, that it rises and falls; or of a harmony,
that it departs and returns. And suppose we say
all this about the first movement of a symphony,
not thinking twice about calling what we hear a
"movement". For we talk as if we hear just that
in the music---movement---and as if any piece of
music indeed moves itself in moving us. 

And the talk has a point. For if we didn't
hear music move, would we hear music at all?
Without movement, music would seem no more than a
succession of sounds, the next following the last
in time. To hear music in this succession
means hearing the next sound follow the last not
just in time, but in space. ---The kind of space
that allows what we hear to quicken and slow, rise
and fall, depart and return. Or to move, in sum,
the way we hear music move.

But there is also a problem with this sort of
talk, despite its point. And it is this problem
that I wish to discuss in my lecture tonight. In
the [first part][part one] of the lecture, I will
explain what I take the problem to be. And in the [second
part][part two], I will explain why I take the
problem to be important. 

#### I. The nature of the problem. [part one]

So what is the problem with our talking as if
music moved? The problem, in a word, is *space*:
the space we hear music move in.
For this space makes something close to complete
sense on the one hand, yet something closer to
nonsense on the other. I begin, then, with [an
account][sense] of what I mean by the complete
sense it makes, before offering a [briefer
account][nonsense] of the nonsense it makes.

##### The sense it makes. [sense] 

To see the sense it makes, we can start by
comparing the movement we hear in music, with
the variation we hear in sounds more generally.
Consider, for example, the difference between a
melody and a siren. Both involve a change in pitch
over time. And we might say, in that respect,
that both rise and fall. But unlike the siren,
the melody does this in a kind of articulated
space, usually conceived as a scale. And it gives
us the impression of movement, from one place to
the next. We sense a change of place, in other
words, *within* the melody's change in pitch, as
if having caused it. To be more specific, suppose
we hear the beginning of "Twinkle Twinkle, Little
Star" on middle-C, where C is followed by the G a
fifth above. Within this change in pitch, we hear
a change of place---from the first degree of a
melodic scale to the fifth, or otherwise put, from
the one-tone to the five-tone. And this change of
place gives us the impression of a movement having
caused the melody's change in pitch: in this case,
the impression of a leap from the one tone to the
five, having caused C to be followed by G. Now
suppose we hear the siren rise from C to G. We
don't hear this rise happen in the articulated
space of a scale; and indeed the continuity of the
siren's change in pitch would seem to preclude it,
since the places in a scale are discrete. But this
means we are given no impression of movement by
the siren's change in pitch, from one place to the
next. It's as if the siren rises and falls only in
time, not in space. True, we can see, or at least
infer, a change of place *behind* the siren's
change in pitch, in the police car or fire engine
that produced it. But we don't hear any similar
change of place *within* the change in pitch, that
might replace the police car or fire engine as
cause, and turn what we hear as a signal into what
we could hear as a melody.

Of course, we may not know the names for the
places in a musical scale, or even have any
conception of such a scale, to account for the
change of place we hear in the melody. But this
ignorance is only more evidence of how much
sense the space of musical movement can make,
in what we might call its *own* terms, without
the need for any theory beyond the music to
justify it. And it reflects a striking fact about
what it means to understand music. For we can
develop an altogether discerning musical ear,
while remaining all but illiterate about what
we hear. 

What is more, becoming literate about what we
hear, by studying some music theory, underlines
the sense it makes even without such a theory. For
as I will now try to show, the topography this
theory comprehends---such as the articulated space
in which we hear the movement of a melody---is
more discovered than invented, and in the
discovery, more inhabited than observed. Indeed,
my conclusion will be that it is because we
finally seem to *inhabit* what we hear, in hearing
music move, that the space it moves in makes
complete sense. The completeness in
this sense of musical space, has to do with the
experience of inhabitance.

To begin to see what I mean by this, let us
take a closer look at the terms I used for the
melody "Twinkle, Twinkle." Consider, first,
the way I identified its first two pitches by
note---middle-C and the G a fifth above. This
identification depends on two topographical facts,
as we might call them, in our perception of
notes, even outside a musical context. The first
such fact is that we hear a difference in pitch,
whereby one note is distinguished from another, as
a difference in relative place: one note sounding
higher, the other note lower. This perception
also proves to be transitive: if one note sounds
higher than a second, and the second higher than a
third, then the first will also sound higher than
the third. Our perception of pitch difference so
gives every note its own position along an axis
of height. Hence my talk of the G a fifth *above*
middle-C, to distinguish it, say, from the C a
fourth below.

Then there is my reference just now to the two
G's on either side of middle-C, along with my reference to
middle-C itself, in order to
distinguish that C from every other
C there is. This repetition of
note letters reflects the second topographical
fact in our perception of notes: the phenomenon
of the octave. For while we distinguish notes
by their difference in pitch, this difference
reaches a kind of limit at the interval called the
"octave." At this interval, the notes sound the
same, despite their difference in pitch, and are
thus given the same letter as name. Exactly *why*
we hear this sameness is hard to say: Aristotle
attributed it to a perception of the whole number
ratio two-to-one; while Victor Zuckerkandl deems it a
miracle. But however it happens, mathematically
or miraculously, the sameness we hear in notes,
once their difference in pitch reaches the octave,
in effect contains that difference. If we pass
beyond it, we don't encounter new notes, but only
new instances, higher or lower, of old notes.
The octave thus turns the axis of height, along
which notes are arranged by pitch, into a kind
of circumference, which continues to trace their
increase or decrease in pitch without end, but
always to the same place again.

Yet this image, of notes now arranged into a
circumference by the phenomenon of the octave,
is not yet an image of the space music
moves in. For it only comprehends the change of pitch
involved, as we might conceive this change to
carry us *along* the circumference. But in hearing
a melody, to recall, we hear not only a change in
pitch, but a change of place *within* the change
in pitch. If we accordingly pressed the image of
our circumference, as I am now about to do, it
would be as if we heard the notes of a melody from
*inside* this circumference, and were carried from
note to note not *along* it, in a mere change of
pitch, but *across* it, in a change of place. So
understood, the circumference becomes an image of
the space music moves in, by becoming an
image of our inhabitance of that space. 

But to see this more clearly, consider again the
beginning of "Twinkle, Twinkle." As I said, we
hear a leap from the one tone to the five tone
*within* the change of pitch from middle-C to
G. This description reflects another pair of
topographical facts in our perception of notes,
once we hear these notes in a musical context.
The first such fact is that we hear movement from
one note to another, without having to hear any
notes between. In the case of "Twinkle, Twinkle",
we hear an initial leap from the one-tone to the
five-, without having to hear the two-, three-,
and four-tone first. And indeed to hear them first
would not complete the leap, as if to fill it
in, but rather transform the leap into a climb.
Why this is a fact of musical perception may
be as hard to explain as the octave. But as a
phenomenon, it seems to involve a sense of being
*oriented* in the movement we hear from note to
note. It is as if we faced the note we were moving
to, and reached it as a goal.

The sense of being oriented among notes is even
clearer in the second topographical fact, which
involves our perception of notes in at least
those musical contexts we call *tonal*. And it is
this fact that forced me to shift from letters
to numbers, when identifying the initial leap
in "Twinkle, Twinkle", from what I called "the
one-tone" to what I called "the five-tone". For in
tonal musical contexts---and the name "tonal" is
derived from this fact---we will hear one note as
a kind of center, which *orients* us with respect
to the other notes we hear, as if to provide a
place from which to face them. The central note
is accordingly assigned the number "one" in analysis,
and the other notes assigned other numbers in
reference to "one". Again, why we are able to hear a
certain note as a center for other notes is hard
to say. But the phenomenon, as Zuckerkandl would
remind us, is dynamic, in an orientation
more felt than seen. We hear the central note as
central, that is, by sensing a stability in it
relative to the other notes, as if it provided a
place to to face them as a center of gravity. This
second topographical fact so informs the first:
for we then move from note to note as if under
the influence of a gravitational pull, requiring
effort to overcome, in a deepened sense of having
faced the note being moved to, and 
reaching that note as a goal.

Or again, to revert to the geometric image of this
inhabitance as I described it above, we hear the
movement in a melody, as in music more generally, 
as if we were *inside* a circumference of notes
arranged by pitch and bounded by the octave. 
For once we hear one note in the melody as
central, especially if we hear it as a center 
of gravity, it is as if that note
has been projected *inside* this circumference
from its place along it. And this projection
allows us to move from
note to note not simply *along* the circumference,
through every note between, but now 
also *across* the circumference, through 
the one note inside it as a guide, or 
center of orientation.   

This is perhaps as far as the circumference image
could, or should, be pressed. But again, it gives
a geometric form to the complete sense made by the
space music moves in. And this is the sense in which we
*inhabit* that space.  To be sure,
the development of this sense, as shown by the
specifically *tonal* context in which we hear
one note of a melody as central, depends on the
like development of a specific form of musical
art---the art of tonality, to which we owe the music of the
West. But there would be no such art to develop,
unless the result made a difference to what we
could hear; and in this case, to what we could
inhabit in what we hear. 

And much of Western music's development can be
explained as a kind of deduction from the features
of a space we inhabit. I spell this thought out
briefly, in one example, for those familiar with
this development. If we truly inhabited the
space music moves in, it seems we
should not be simply fixed at a single center
of orientation. We should rather be able move
that center, carrying it with us from place to
place. And move it we can---once Western music
developed the device of modulation, to carry
us from key to key. We might also expect the
movement of that center to happen along an axis
of depth, away and back, not just to distinguish
it from the up-and-down movement between notes
along an axis of height, but also from a sense
of perspective, which implicitly belongs to our
sense of orientation when we inhabit a space.
And so we do move away and back---once Western
music developed the harmony out of polyphony that
modulation relies upon. We might further expect
the movement of the center to clarify our sense,
as I described this above, of the gravitational
forces at work in such a space. And clarified
they are---once the use of modulation effectively
reduced the modes of chant to the major-minor
scale. We might finally expect the movement of the
center to deepen our sense that we inhabit *one*
space, which *contains* the places moved between,
rather than many spaces distinguished and divided
by those places. And deepened it is---once the use
of modulation forced upon the tuning of a scale
the leveling of equal temperament, restricting the
notes of *any* key to the notes in *every* key,
and thereby placing "the whole of tonal space," as
Roger Scruton has strikingly put it, "within reach
of its every occupant."[^fn-1]

[^fn-1]: Roger Scruton, *The Aesthetics of Music*, p. 244.

Along with this kind of deduction of Western
music's development from the features of a
space we inhabit, comes a plausible if simple
measure of the greatness in a musical work. The
greater it is, the deeper it carries us into
the space music moves in. And by that measure
of inhabitance, the best demonstration of the
complete sense this space can make, is found not
in the account I have just given of it, but rather
in those masterpieces of Western music---such as
Beethoven's *Eroica*---where this space
is explored to a kind of limit, in the conquest of
it.

***

But so much, then, for *my* account of the kind of sense
this space seems to make. It is time to show why it also
makes a kind of nonsense, despite
my account, and all the masterpieces
of Western music notwithstanding.    


##### The nonsense it makes. [nonsense] 

To see this, we can start by now comparing
the movement we hear in music, with motion as
we observe this more generally. Consider, for
example, the difference between the movement of
a melody, like "Twinkle, Twinkle" again, and the
motion of our hand in following that melody, as
if to conduct it. We could say that both rise and
fall, and do so not just in time but in space,
through a discernible change of place. But there
is also a difference. For as I discussed earlier,
we hear the change of place in the melody, such
as the leap from the one-tone to the five-tone in
"Twinkle, Twinkle", without having to hear any
tones between. The movement happens, so we might
say, *discretely*. By contrast, we see the hand's
change of place happen *continuously*, from place
to place through *all* the places between. And
this continuity would seem a necessary feature
of its motion. For if our hand got from place to
place discretely, like the melody did, skipping
places along the way, then it would look to us as
if our hand reached each place not by motion, but
rather by magic. Or at least we would be tempted
to think there was something in the space where
the motion occurred, beyond *just space*, that
was interrupting the motion, disrupting the
continuity the motion would otherwise have. But
this is one reason, then, to think that there
isn't really a space for the melody to move in.
For if there were, then it would allow the melody
to move in it continuously rather than discretely.

But this points to a still deeper difference
between the movement of the melody and the
motion of our hand in following it. For the
melody is *composed* of the notes it moves
between, while our hand is not so composed of the
places it moves between. And this explains at once
why the melody has to move discretely.  It has to
move discretely, because it has *to become* what
it is. And this means passing through only those
notes that compose it, and that
distinguish it, thus composed, from any other
melody. But then the melody can only *be* what it
is by becoming so, over an interval of time.  And
in this sense, the melody is temporal rather than
spatial. But this is then another reason, and a more
decisive reason, to think that there isn't really
a space for the melody to move in. For if there
were, then it would allow the melody to be spatial
rather than temporal; which is to say, it would
allow the melody to *be* what it is in space
without having to become so, and to remain what it
is, unchanged, through every change of place.

But let me try to put the problem with the space
the melody moves in a different way, that captures
the nonsense of this space more strongly. The
melody is not a spatial whole, like our hand, but
rather a temporal whole. But this means that the
space the melody moves in can only contain one
note of the melody at a time. And *this* means,
speaking strictly if nonsensically, that there is
no melody to hear, in the space we hear it move.
When I say we hear a leap in "Twinkle, Twinkle"
from the \\(\scriptstyle{\hat{1}}\\) tone to the
\\(\scriptstyle{\hat{5}}\\) tone, there is nothing
audible making the leap. But how, in that case,
could there *be* any leap to hear? And what could
be making it? Or we could put the nonsense more
generally like this. In music, we hear a movement
between unmoving notes. But this means we hear a
movement without hearing anything actually move.
And in this sense, music never makes a sound. But
how can this be? What could we be hearing that
never makes a sound?

Yet this is only the start of the nonsense; and
the end of the nonsense implicates the very
way we seem to inhabit the space in which we
hear music move. We can see this through an
objection to the analysis I just gave. True, the
objection runs, we have a sense of the space in
which motion ordinarily occurs, that we cannot
apply to the movement of music. For applying it
makes nonsense of the movement, by depriving
this movement of any object to which it could be
attributed. But what follows from this? Perhaps
only that the space in which music moves is not
ordinary, but extraordinary. And this is one
way to understand my earlier defense of the
sense---the complete sense---made by the space in
which music moves. For as I accounted for it, this
was not an observed sense of space, but rather an
inhabited sense. The sense, for example, in which
we *face* the note being moved to, and reach it as a
goal. So if there *is* a space for music to move
in, which makes sense of the movement, then this
space will have to be understood from within, as a
matter of inhabitance, rather than from without,
as a matter of observation. 

Well, fair enough. But this makes the nonsense
of such a space even easier to see. For what is
it, finally, that makes an inhabited sense of
space extraordinary rather than ordinary? Here
is one answer I find plausible---and it is the
answer given, for example, by Heidegger, when he
speaks of our being-in-the-world. An inhabited
sense of space is extraordinary, in not stopping
short of totality. That is, our inhabited sense
of space implicitly includes everything there is,
known or unknown; anything captured in the word
"Being". For it is beings, finally, that we take
ourselves to be surrounded by, and our own being
that provides the place from which to face them.
This is why, despite our sometimes talking as if
there were more than one world, and even more
than one world we might inhabit, we can also talk
intelligibly, in a simpler yet deeper way, of
*the* world. And it is our being-in-the-world, in
this sense, that grounds our inhabited sense of
space.


But what happens, then, when our inhabited sense
of space is divided?---for example, between
sleeping and dreaming, where it seems we inhabit
two spaces at once? We resolve the division,
evidently, by conferring worldhood on only one
such space, and taking it to contain the other
such space. That is, we credit only one such
space with the totality, and thus the reality,
of inhabitance; and regard the other space as
merely part of this totality. The credit we give
to its own totality, then, is the credit we give
to a dream. We still inhabit the dream, indeed
more alertly and attentively than we inhabit the
bedroom in which we dream---and often with a sense
that everything is put at stake in the dream, in
a matter of life or death. But in waking from the
dream, we prove it to be part of a larger space of
inhabitance; and this gives the dream's apparent
totality the status of mere appearance, and our
inhabitance of it, the form of an illusion. To our
relief, or perhaps our regret, what happened to us
in the dream, didn't really happen after all; and
there was nothing at stake rather than everything.

But if this is so, then it gives us reason to
suspect the very same thing of the space we
inhabit when hearing music move. The space may
well be illusory, making all the sense---but also
all the nonsense---of a dream. And in that case,
the greater the work of music is, the deeper it
carries us into the dream. We hear the sound of
Beethoven's *Eroica* surge forth in a concert
hall, seeming to making an entire world shake. Yet
the musicians barely move by comparison, while the
notes they play move not at all; and we ourselves
stay glued to our seats---entranced. And once the
work is finished, in a triumph of conclusiveness,
we are released from the trance in a daze, and
in the desire, perhaps, to have remained. For we
leave the concert hall likely finding the world
we truly inhabit unchanged by what we heard, and
nothing comparable to its conclusiveness in the
life we have to live.

This, then, is what I take to be the problem
with our talking as if music moved. Talking that
way, thinking that way, fails to distinguish our 
experience of music from a dream, in which nothing
we experience really happens. 

#### II. The importance of the problem. [part two] 

As I said at the start of my lecture, I also
take this problem to be important. To explain
why, I want to discuss this problem again, but
now as a problem not simply with our experience
of music, but more generally, with our experience
of the world. For we talk, and think, not just as
if music moved, but as if *anything* moved. But
this too involves a kind of nonsense, known since
the time of Parmenides and Zeno. To see this,
consider again the rise and fall of our hand, as
it follows the rise and fall of a melody. Earlier,
in distinguishing our hand from the melody, I said
that we see the hand's change of place happen
continuously rather than discretely. In other
words, it happens from place to place through
*all* the places between rather than just some of
them. I also said that this continuity seemed 
a necessary feature of its motion; for it us
that the hand got from place to place by motion
rather than by magic. I further attributed this
continuity to the fact that our hand is a 
*spatial* whole, that space can then contain, at
every moment of its motion.

But a moment's reflection on this reveals a
problem. For the sense in which our hand is a
spatial whole, which space can then contain,
is the sense in which our hand can *occupy* a place,
without having to move there. But
this occupation of place implies that space only
contains the hand *at* a place, as an occupant
of it, at any moment of its motion. We can grant
that the hand will be at *every* such place over
the course of the motion, and even suppose that
every such place taken together forms a continuum.
But this turns out not to be the continuum of the
motion itself, but rather just the continuum of
the motion's path, which as a path, doesn't move.

What is more, the most obvious way of solving this
problem is to turn our attention from the motion's
path to the motion itself; but this suggests
the same analysis of the motion that we earlier
gave of the melody---to the same nonsensical
conclusion. The hand may be a spatial whole,
but its motion is a temporal whole, just like a
melody. So space cannot contain the hand's entire
motion at any moment of it, but only one part
of the motion, one place in it, at a time. But
this again seems to mean, speaking strictly if
nonsensically, that there is no hand to be seen,
in the space where we see it move. For the hand
is only seen in the space it can occupy, which is
the space where it remains unmoved. Or we could
put the nonsense more generally like this. In any
case of motion, what we see is a motion between
unmoving places, of something that occupies those
places. But this suggests we see motion, without
seeing anything actually move. But how, then, 
could there be any motion to see? And what could
be making it?

One answer to these questions, 
the kind of answer Zeno might give, is that there
*isn't* any motion to see. When we think we see
something move, all we really see is that it
occupies different places at different times. And
the appearance of motion in this, is something
like the appearance of motion on a movie screen,
projected from a succession of stills, each of a
single place and time, that happens too rapidly
for us to detect. But this kind of answer to the
question leads to a second answer, found for
example in mathematical calculus, in which there
*is* a motion to see. For suppose that when we
think we see something move, all we really see
is that it occupies different places at different
times. Still, there turn out to be more such
places---infinitely more, in fact---than we could
ever arrange from one to the next, as if on a
strip of film. The places are many enough, that
is, to form a *real* continuum, beyond the mere
appearance of one in a rapid enough succession
from one place to the next. And this makes for a real
continuity in the motion we think we see, giving
it all the reality it needs.

There is a sense, however, in which this second
answer misses the point. For the continuum in
question again belongs to the motion's path rather
than the motion itself. And indeed, the way this
path is proved to form a continuum---for example,
in Dedekind---is by analogy to a line, undivided
by time, where every point upon it is present at
once. But it would seem only when we conceive this
line divided by time, where only one point upon it
is ever present at once, that we have the right
analogy for the continuum formed the motion rather
than by the motion's path. But how can the line
divided by time in this way prove continuous, at
least by the spatial measure of mathematics, if
the line is made of only one point at a time?

This second answer thus leads to a third
answer, which is found implicitly, I think, in
Aristotle, and more explicitly in Bergson. It is
distinguished from the first answer in taking the
motion we see to be real, and from the second
answer in taking this reality to involve more than
just the continuity of the motion's path. But the
promise of this answer comes at a price: for it
embraces the nonsense that makes the problem a
problem. On this answer, that is, there is indeed
nothing to see, in the space where we see anything
move. And this is because the space where we see
anything move, is the space where the motion
belongs to us, rather than to anything we might
see outside us. So there *is* a motion to see,
when we are the ones making it. Or to put this
claim in the terms I used earlier, motion occurs
in the space we inhabit, rather than in the space
we observe. In the space we observe, we see only
the continuous path of a motion, occupied at
every place by the thing that moves. But in the
space we inhabit, we see the motion itself, which
is not simply continuous, but indivisible. The
motion in this indivisible sense stretches from
the beginning of its path to the end in a single
bound, as if the entire path were a single place
for the moving thing to occupy. And we experience
this indivisibility when moving ourselves. For in
that case, we face the end of the motion at the
beginning of it, and reach the end as a goal,
heedless of all the places occupied along the way.
And this is then very like the way we
seem to move, indivisibly so we might say, from note to note in
a melody, heedless of any notes passed along the
way.

But what should we make of this answer? It
makes the same appeal to our inhabited sense of
space that we saw might be used to make sense
of the movement in music, only now to make sense
of motion as such. But the problem with that
appeal in the case of music, to recall, was that
it left the space in which music seems to move
indistinguishable from a dream. So does the appeal
to our inhabited sense of space fare any better,
when this is now taken to be the space in which
anything seems to move? That is, can we know,
or show, that we are not dreaming when we see
anything move?

The question put this generally might seem absurd.
After all, to suppose we were dreaming when we
saw anything moved, would mean supposing that
there was something about our inhabitance of *the
world* that proved illusory; and not simply our
inhabitance of so-called other worlds, such as
dreams in the ordinary sense, or music, that we
might plausibly find illusory in their proving
to be *contained* in the world, or mere parts of
that totality. But there is good reason to suppose
something close to this unsettling prospect about
our inhabitance of the world; and it explains why
a question like "Are we dreaming right now?" has
been raised with seriousness in philosophy---for
example, by Descartes. For while we may not be
dreaming when we see anything move, there is
arguably nothing in our inhabitance of the world
to prove this; for if there were, so the argument
goes, we would not inhabit the world but merely
observe it, from some place outside it. To see
why this argument is worth considering, think
about why our dreams, taking "dreams" now in the
ordinary sense, can so often contain implausible
or even impossible events, not to mention the
sense in which all its events, once we wake up,
prove unreal. One explanation for our credulity
about dreams when dreaming is that while there
might be something we encounter in a dream to wake
us up from it, there is nothing we encounter in
a dream to tell us we are dreaming; and this is
why we inhabit dreams rather than merely observe
them. If there were anything *to tell* us we were
dreaming, we wouldn't be dreaming. But it seems we
can offer this same explanation more generally:
there is nothing we encounter in the world to
tell us the encounter is illusory, and this is
why we inhabit the world rather than merely observe
it. For if there were anything *to tell* us the
encounter was illusory, we wouldn't be having the
encounter.

So this, then, is what I take to be the importance
of the problem with our talking as if music moved.
For it illustrates a more general problem with
our talking as if anything moved. And talking
that way, thinking that way, fails 
to distinguish our experience of the world from
a dream, in which nothing we experience really
happens.

#### Conclusion
[Solutions to the problem.]

<!-- Perhaps move lack of sign of illusion
to sense in which it isn't an illusion. Also

When I compared the rise and fall of our (Present

in light of the aim of
liberal education. as a problem of education. think the problem is important. (Start with liberal
education point. Opinion about world not a deep
enough point)

I think the problem *is* important. And to
begin to explain why, I want to offer an argument 
that the problem with our talking as if music
moved, is actually for the following claim: the problem with our talking as if
music moved, turns out to be the problem with our
talking as if *anything* moved. And the sense in
which our experience of music might well be only a
dream, turns out to be the sense in which our
experience of anything might well be only a dream. in failing to
distinguish our experience of music from a dream,
we are actually failing to distinguish our
experience of anything from a dream. 

But why is this a problem worth
describing, much less resolving? What makes it
important?  we
should care about, especially those of us with
little interest would this be an important
problem? is this an important problem?
And if it is important, then why? 

I called what I just described *a suspicion*: the
suspicion that music doesn't really move, and that
we are dreaming, in effect, when we hear it move.
And if music must move to be music at all, then
the suspicion is that we are dreaming when we hear
music, period, when
we hear it move, we are dreaming. we are dreaming when hearing music
move, and that it doesn't really move.  that we are then dreaming in hearing
music at all, and if music is only music if it moves, about
music, Nothing in what I just described, of course,
*proves* that the description is true. I haven't
yet given an argument that we are dreaming, in any
recognizable, Perhaps we
aren't ne of what I have just suggested, of course,
*proves* that the suggestion is true.  I haven't
shown that we are dreaming in any sense when
hearing music move; or, if music is only music
when it moves, that we are dreaming when hearing
music at all. But I think this suggestion gives 
a graphic sense of indeed in hearing music
at all, if music is only music when it moves. But I think the suggestion
gives  Let this suffice, then, as an account of the
problem with our talking as if music moved. What
of its importance? Should we care that we might be
dreaming when hearing music move---or indeed, when
hearing music at all, if music is only music when
it moves? Perhaps this problem is only a problem
for lovers of music, in the prospect that what
they love is nothing more than an illusion, and
thus without any place in a serious life---which
is to say, a life in which we refuse to be guided
or satisfied by illusions. But those of us without
that love likely suspected as much, in taking
music, when it isn't simply an intrusion upon
life, as a distraction, or at least diversion,
from life.

But I now want to argue that this response to the
problem mistakes the nature and extent of it;
and that the problem has an importance for all
of us. And by "all of us", I mean those of us
here tonight, who are serious enough about life
to have pursued the kind of education---liberal
education---that promises us the freedom required
by a serious life. What this freedom entails may
be hard to say, or even to know. But it seems
safe enough to say that the freedom entailed, is
at least a freedom from just the sort of illusion
that music may induce---the illusion of a dream.
For we could say that being free, in the sense
required by a serious life, at least means being
awake. But dreams, in giving us the illusion
of being awake, keep us asleep. Or to speak of
this sleep less metaphorically, we could say
that dreams involve the illusion of
inhabitance, which means they have the power to make us
not simply encounter what isn't really there, but
to embrace it, in a satisfaction with the illusion
that causes what *is* really there to vanish,
in effect, along with any hope of a life that
dispels the illusion.

But if this is so, then the aim of liberal
education, under one description, would be to wake
us up, not simply from sleep, but from the kind of
sleep in which we seem awake to ourselves. Liberal
education, then, would aim to wake us up from
a dream. (Put Heideggerian language here.) (Revise from here. If music is a dream --- but in fact inhabitance itself has all the features of the dream, and there is no way to be woken from it. What this means for liberal education I will conclude with.) And if one such dream is the movement
we hear in a succession of unmoving sounds,
then at least this is what a liberal education
should wake us up from, and dispel the illusion
we call music. We should then study a work of
Beethoven's or Bach's, if at all, not as if
it contained inexpressible truth, but something
closer to inexcusable falsehood, which convicted
its composer of sophistry, or sorcery, under the show of
profundity. (That we don't study Bach). So one thing at stake is whether it is
a dream, and if so, how would we know. An answer has
been given, to a question hardly asked)-->

<!-- Leftover stuff

But since I assume
rather more interest in music in my account of
the problem itself, and that account is rather
long, I will say this much now
about my sense of its importance, in case it
helps anyone sit through the first part of my
lecture more expectantly, or at least patiently.
While I present this specifically as a problem
in our experience of music, I take it to be a
problem, more generally, in our experience of the
world. And at stake in the problem, on that level,
is the prospect of our freedom in the world.
So understood---or at least as I will want to
understand it---the problem thus poses a challenge
to liberal education---indeed, to the very idea
of liberal education. But more on that in [Part
Two][part two].

Or alternative formulation: if the movement we hear
in music is an illusion, then freedom is an illusion;
and if freedom is illusion, then liberal education
is an illusion. music doesn't move,
then we can't be free, and if we can't be free,
then any education that promises to make us free
is an illusion.-->


<!-- Stuff to maybe include 

Then, in moving to issue with space, make it one
of inhabitance, where we seem in two worlds at
once.

is that we will hear
one note of in a melody
as a kind of center, which *orients* us with
respect to the other notes in the melody, as if
to provide a place from which to face them. The
central note is accordingly assigned the number
1 for the purposes of melodic analysis, and the
other notes assigned other numbers---2, 3, and so
on---making implicit reference to 1. The two facts seem to be related: we
hear melody as central, again as if from a place
to face the other notes, we also move that way
between notes in the melody, as if woves us from
one note to another, on the circumference I just
described, by putting us, as it were, *inside* the
circumference, not by carrying us *along* it, in
a mere change of pitch, but rather *across* it,
in a change of place. , and across it by being
put inside the circumference, in what is then an
image of inhabitance. To see this, consider again
the beginning of "Twinkle, Twinkle" as I described
this above, where we hear a leap from the ˆ1 tone
to the ˆ5 tone *within* the change of pitch from
middle C to G. The shift from letters to numbers
in our classification of notes We classify notes
this way by number, not merely by letter, to
reflect yet another pair of topographical facts
in our perception of notes, both involving a
sense of orientation, once we hear these notes in
a musical context like a melody. The first such
fact is that we hear one note in a melody as a
kind of center, which *orients* us with respect to
the other notes in the melody, as if to provide a
place from which to face them. The central note is
accordingly assigned the number 1 for the purposes
of melodic analysis, and the other notes assigned
other numbers---2, 3, and so on---making implicit
reference to 1. The second topographical fact is
that we hear movement from one note to another
without having to hear any notes between. We hear
a leap from the ˆ1 tone to the ˆ5 in "Twinkle,
Twinkle," for example, without having to hear
the ˆ2,ˆ3, or ˆ4 tones first; and indeed to hear
them first would turn the leap into a climb. This
second fact, like the first, involves a sense of
orientation produced by musical contexts like
melodies produce: so just as we then hear one note
in the melody as central, again as if from a place
to face the other notes, so we also move that way
between notes, as if we faced the note we were
moving to, and then reached it as a goal, without
needing to take account of any in-between notes
silently passed along the way. The two facts seem
to be related: we hear melody as central, again as
if from a place to face the other notes, we also
move that way between notes in the melody, as if
we

the orientation
provided by that note, across the circumference
and through that note, from one note to another
subsequently made, will *not* then be made *along* the
circumference, or from one note to another through every
note between.  The movement will rather be made through none
of the notes between in being made *across* the
circumference, through its central point, in a geometric
reflection of the way we seem to inhabit musical space in
hearing music move, from one note to the other not through
every note between, but rather through the orientation
provided by a central such note.

This is perhaps as far as this image of a circumference
should be pressed for the purposes , but that we
find ourselves inside of, A geometric image of inhabitance. Inhabitance, perspective,
mobility, even equal temperament. Make sure to discuss
these in terms of the experience that makes them viable

(Keep facing language. Leap as if
making it ourselves, rather than watching it from
the side. Relates to Zuckerkandl point, that the
orientation comes with gravity, stability.) In
this example, the central note is middle C, thus

scale by number recall the melodic scale I invoked
to describe the initial change of place in the
melody:

it.)

sense the move from note to note isn't through
every note between, like the siren.) (Mention

melodic scale. Same place again can be heard
as a center, as if projected to a point inside
the circumference, and which orients us with
respect to that circumference. as if this place
were projected to a center. .(Mention specific
example of middle C and G.) This introduces ,
gain, within the change of pitch that would carry
us along this circumference, we hear a change of
place, For again, we hearOnce the notes on that
circumference are selected and arrangedFor in
reaching the same place againFor as indicated by
a melodic scale, reaching the same place again
means hearing it as a center that organizes the
notes in between, as if as a projection from this
place. And Zuckerkandl points out, our perception
of this center is not static or merely spatial,
but dynamic, as if the center possossed gravity.
And the center can change, it is mobile; while
harmony contributes perspective. Then there is
equal temperament, which in Scruton's words There
is then (revise from here: longest distance return
to same, so circumferential, then talk about being
centered and feeling weight or gravity, then
move on the center moving through modulation and
harmony giving depth, perhaps equal temperment) a
topography so real as to be inhabited.

Our sense of the place we inhabit is not that it is merely
a part of some larger whole, but rather than it is finally
that whole.

But what kind of space could this be, that allows
music to move? And where is it, in relation to
the space we ordinarily inhabit? When we find
ourselves in a symphony hall, for example, with
musicians seated in their chairs, yet hear
the sounds of Beethoven's *Eroica*
surging forth, where has the music taken us? Out of the
symphony hall? Deeper into the symphony hall? Are we in our
heads? has the music taken us? and hear
Beethoven's *Eroica* surge forth even as the
musicians playing it are comparatively motionless
in their chairs, ,In paragraph where space doesn't make sense, point out
that where is space, if outside of us? 
which means (talk about occupying a place) that
notes are not simply arranged by pitch in a
relative position of lower and higher; they also
form extremitiesgives notes a sense of place
beyond higher and lower, Thus the sameness we
hear giving to notes an octave apart a deeper
sense of place that comprehends their relative
position of higher or lower. ; while still hearing
a difference in pitch. Indeed, this difference is
maximal rather than minimal: it is not the pitches
we can barely distinguish as lower or higher to
one another that prove to sound the same in this
sense; but rather the pitches we most easily so
distinguish. So the sameness we hear establishes
a sense of place that comprehends the higher
and lower; beyond higher and lower; different
pitches can occupy this place in sounding the
same, despite their distance from one another
in pitch. Moreover, this distance---to which we
give the name "octave"---turns out to be maximal
rather than minimal; the sense of place is more
like a circumference that contains the pitches of
a melody. In a still-more important feature of
this perception, the sameness we hear in these
pitches corresponds to a difference between them
that is maximal rather than minimal, measured
by the octave. So the sense of place is of a
circumference rather than a latitude or longitude.

  And since the sameness we hear is that
different pitches can occupy, beyond the
positions that distinguishes them by pitch.
the position that their difference in pitch
determines., which pitches can occupy rather than
merely determine. can be occupied by different
pitches. the sameness we hear comes with an
implicit sense of place, occupied by entities
otherwise separated by pitch. of sameness
seems to be a sense of place, occupied by many
pitches indefinitely many pitches. at a kind of
extremity of distance, measured by the octave,
from one such pitch to the next, And the sense
of place comes with a kind of circumference,
which contains every other pitch that doesn't so
sound the same, since the place is occupied by
pitches that are otherwise most different rather
than least different, in a kind of containing of
all the pitches between, the sense of place is a
sense of circumference.

 This fact of musical perception gives an
implicit sense o. and to which we thus give the

the point of musical theory in this sense is to
account for a topography of perception---and
more generally, the possibility that we can
have an altogether discerning musical ear while
remaining all but illiterate about what we
hear, yet--is one of the only more evidence for
how much sense the space of musical motion can
make. For the point of musical theory, in this
respect, is not to construct that space but
rather to illuminate it, in something like the
way a forest is illuminated once you know the
names of the trees in it, giving us the words and
concepts to say we already hear, when we hear
music in a succession of sounds.(revise from
here) to have established a more or less complete

in question (mention usual way of dividing
pitch by places, then by scale in recurrence
that suggests a circumference to space, then by
stability, home-location, that suggests a gravity

modulation.) we almost surely can't identify the
pitches in question, at least by ear, under the
description that nowadays distinguishes them,
in terms of the frequency at which a wavelength
vibrates. For frequency in this sense is able to
define a pitch by abstracting from any sense of
its place. But for those few of us with perfect
pitch, even the recognition of pitch will come
with an implicit sense of place, according to
where we hear middle C, followed by the G a
fifth above . And in hearing pitches at the
frequencies, the pitches at frequencies of
identifying even just the pitches of the melody
will be to identify the pitches of the melody,
for example, as middle C, And when we identify

This distinguishes the movement in music from
the movement in mere sound, There is no such
change in place that we hear in a mere sound,
like a siren, whose rise and fall involves only
a change in pitch over time. Unlike the rise and
fall of a siren, for example, where we hear a
continuous change of pitch over time, the rise
and fall of melodythis movement as a change in
place. (Say what places are.) And this change in
place distinguishes music from mere sound, which
changes in time. , we could say that when we hear
music move---at least of any kind that includes
not just rhythm, but melody and harmony---we
hear the movement as a change in place, and we
can be more or less exact about the places in
question. So, we don't hear a melody just rise
and fall; we hear it rise and fall in moving
from one tone to another in a scale of such
tones---say, from the 1 tone up to the 5, then
down again to the 1. Similarly, we don't hear
the harmony supporting that melody just depart
and return; we hear it depart and return by
moving from one chord to another in a scale of
such chords---say, from tonic to dominant and
back again to tonic. It is this exactness about
the space in which music moves that allows it
to be composed and encoded on a musical score,
even though the score itself is soundless and
motionless. It is also this exactness that allows
music to be analyzed and studied, rather than
merely heard and appreciated. And one way of
understanding the history of music, at least in
the West, is as a progress in such exactness And
that music happens in so articulable a space is
what seems to distinguishes it from mere sound,
which happens, by contrast, in time rather than
space. it is the space of music in this sense
that distinguishes it from mere sound, which by
contrast happens only in time.

between the so-called degrees of a melodic or
harmonic scale. (Put the next bit later, to
suggest music is an illusion.)

So again, on the one hand, the motion we hear in
music would seem to be real enough to happen in
a completely accountable kind of space. Yet on
the other hand, (motionless score; motionless
orchestra; and that space otherwise allows
for continuity of motion and identity through
time precluded by musical space; then maybe
mention hand, not following the motion but
supplying it, that music moves in moving us.)
other difficulties). . articulated kind of space.
(What do previous paragraphs show about the
reality of space.) The fact that music can be so
immediately distinguished from sound

And how could it be otherwise? After all, if
music happens in time, and time is a measure of
motion, then music, it would seem, is a motion
in turn; and for lovers of music, among the most
meaningful such motions in their lives.

(Put weirdness below) Space weird (symphony

literacy, and what distinguishes music from mere
sound. (Space differentiated enough to the music
not just in time, but in a kind of space. change
not just in time, but in space. The motion is
a form of *locomotion*, or motion from place
to place. But then again, time is not the only
measure of motion, at least if by "motion", we
mean *locomotion*, or a motion from place to
place. Of motion in this sense, one measure is
time, but another is space. ---The space, for
example, in which a bird rises and falls in
flight. Or the space, by seeming resemblance,
in which a melody rises and falls; and more
generally, in which music---at least of any
kind that involves not just beats but tones,
not just rhythm but melody and harmony---indeed
moves, from place to place, rising and falling,
departing and returning, very like the motion of
a bird in flight.

Transition paragraph: mention that Zuckerkandl
discusses this in Sound and Symbol even if not
in Sense of Music, and it strikes me as an
important issue, perhaps the most significant
issue, in understanding music, and its place in
the liberal arts. Slavery and free. (Make new
paragraph here: about how music also happens in
space as a movement; music is not simply change.
Perhaps use motion picture paragraph to indicate
difference in the illusoriness of music and
illusoriness of motion pictures. Organize replies
to evident illusoriness of motion in terms of
motion being an illusion, being an appearance,
and being a reality, in rough correspondence to
the distinction made in Plato's Sophist. Also
mention music as a kind of liberal art.)

(Rough organization: music as illusion, (and
being serious about music means being serious
about the possibility that it may be a waste
of time). but problem with difference between
illusion and appearance, such as difference
between movies and paintings. Thus music
as appearance, but problem with unexamined
assumptions about motion. Music as reality.)

(End with showing, how through compound ratio,
time is not simply one-dimensional, or even an
added dimension.)

But there may be less reason to accept this
conclusion than to deny it; and to wonder, then,
how meaningful music finally is. For the meaning
of music in this sense, upon reflection, would
seem to depend on the illusion of movement rather
than the reality of it, in something like the
way that a motion picture, despite its name,
only seems to move, being nothing in truth but
a series of photographs, or frames, on a strip
of plastic. Music, too, may be nothing in truth
but the series of notes that we find indelibly
and immovably marked in a score. Once these
notes are played in succession, just as once
those frames are shown in succession, they give
us the inescapable impression of something's
moving, even though nothing is moving. No frame
or note, after all, could be said to move itself
in the succession, or somehow fuse with the
next frame or note to render that succession a
genuine transition. Yet we sense transition in
the succession all the same, in what is then a
mere image of motion, without a similarly moving
origin.

And the absence of actual motion in music would
seem still more radical, if we now *contrast* the
notes that compose it with the frames of a motion
picture. For those frames, at least in the usual
case, are of a scene in which the actors really
move, taken and projected rapidly enough to
reproduce that real motion upon a screen, so far
as the eye can tell. But there is no such scene
of real motion that the notes of music could be
said to record and reproduce for the ear. And
the scene of real motion closest to the music
we hear---the musicians playing it---is all but
motionless compared to the music being played,
as the players stay seated in their chairs, for
example, while the sound of Beethoven's *Eroica*
surges forth. Indeed, it would seem necessary
for the notes in a piece of music to be *unlike*
the frames in a motion picture, if we are to
hear movement in their succession, at least the
movement we identify as music. For the succession
should not happen rapidly enough to blur the
distinction between notes, lest the music vanish
in a siren of noise; and the notes themselves
should refer only, or at least principally, to
one another in that succession, rather than to
any scene beyond, lest the music vanish again, in
a kind of picture-painting.

And even this much analysis of the difference
between our sense of motion generally and our
sense of motion in music depends on our taking the
notes of music not simply as sounds, occupying
particular moments of time, but also as tones,
occupying particular places in space---in this
case, the places in space that allow us to say the
melody rises and falls. But what kind of places in
space are this? What kind of space is this? And
*where* is it? Surely not where the singer of the
melody is, or as if the melody could rise and fall
in the same sky inhabited by the bird. But if the
space in which music moves is not the same space
in which we encounter motion otherwise, then why
credit our talk of the motion in music with any
but a metaphorical sense? it looks as if we are
speaking only metaphorically in saying that music
moves.-->
