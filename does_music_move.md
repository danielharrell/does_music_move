### Does Music Move?

Does music move?


Well, yes---if by "music", we meant the
vibrations of sound that allow us to hear what a
musician plays: from instrument to air to ear.

Or yes again---if by "move", we meant the way
we can indeed be *moved* by music: from
table-taps to tangos to tears.

But the question becomes harder to answer, if we
ask it of music and movement in a more elementary
sense. ---The sense in which we might say, of
a rhythm, that it quickens and slows; or of a
melody, that it rises and falls; or of a harmony,
that it departs and returns. And suppose we say
all this about the first movement of a symphony,
not thinking twice about calling what we hear a
"movement". For we talk as if we hear just that
in the music---movement---and as if any piece of
music indeed moves itself in moving us. 

The talk has a point. For if we didn't
hear music move, would we hear it at all?
Without movement, music would seem no more than a
series of sounds. But there is a problem
with this sort of talk, despite its point. And
it is this problem that I wish to discuss in my
lecture tonight. In the [first part][part one]
of the lecture, I will explain what I take the
problem to be. And in the [second part][part
two], I will explain why I take the problem to
be important---even for those of us with little
interest in music.

#### I. The nature of the problem. [part one]

So what is the problem with our talking as if
music moved? The problem, in a word, is *space*:
the space in which music moves, when we hear it
as music. ---The space that allows a rhythm to
quicken and slow, or a melody to rise and fall,
or a harmony to depart and return. This space, I
want to argue, makes something close to [complete
sense][sense] on the one hand, yet something
closer to [nonsense][nonsense] on the other.


##### The sense it makes. [sense] 

To see the sense it makes, we can start by
comparing the movement we hear in music, with
the variation we hear in sounds more generally.
Consider, for example, the difference between a
melody and a siren. Both involve a change in pitch
over time. And we might say, in that respect, that
both rise and fall. But unlike the siren, the
melody does this in a kind of articulated space,
usually conceived as a scale. And this space gives
us the impression of movement, from one place to
the next. We sense a change of place, in other
words, *within* the melody's change in pitch, as
if having caused it. 
    
Suppose, for example, that we hear the beginning
of "Twinkle Twinkle, Little Star" on middle-C,
where C is followed by the G a fifth above.
Within this change in pitch, we hear a change of
place---from the first degree of a melodic scale
to the fifth; or otherwise put, from the one-tone
to the five-tone. And this change of place gives
us the impression of a movement having caused the
melody's change in pitch: in this case, of a leap
from the one-tone to the five-, causing C to be
followed by G.

Now suppose we hear the siren rise from C to G.
We don't hear this rise happen in the articulated
space of a scale; and indeed the continuity of the
rise would seem to preclude it, since the places
in a scale are discrete. But this means we are
given no impression of movement by the siren's
change in pitch, from one place to the next. It's
as if the siren rises and falls only in time, not
in space. True, we can see, or at least infer,
a change of place *behind* the siren's change
in pitch, in the police car or fire engine that
produced it. But we don't hear any change
of place *within* the change in pitch, that might
replace the police car or fire engine as cause,
and turn what we hear as a signal into what we
could hear as a melody.

Of course, we may not know about a musical scale,
to account for the change of place we hear in
the melody. But this ignorance is only more
evidence for the sense made by the space of
music's movement, in its *own* terms. And it
reflects a striking fact about what it means to
understand music. For we can develop an altogether
discerning musical ear, while remaining all but
illiterate about what we hear.

And becoming literate, by studying music theory,
underlines the sense music makes even without
this theory. For as I will now try to show,
the topography this theory comprehends---such
as the melodic scale---is more discovered than
invented, and in the discovery, more inhabited
than observed. Indeed, my conclusion will be
that it is because we finally seem to *inhabit*
what we hear, in hearing music move, that the
space of this movement makes complete sense. The
completeness of this sense has to
do with the experience of inhabitance.

To begin to see this, let us take a closer
look at the terms I used for the melody "Twinkle,
Twinkle." Consider, first, the way I identified
its first two pitches by note---middle-C and the
G a fifth above. This identification depends on
two topographical facts, in our perception of
notes, even outside a musical context. The first
such fact is that we hear a difference in pitch,
whereby one note is distinguished from another, as
a difference in relative place: one note sounding
higher, the other note lower. This perception
is also transitive: if one note sounds
higher than a second, and the second higher than a
third, then the first will also sound higher than
the third. Our perception of pitch difference so
gives every note its own position along an axis
of height. Hence my talk of the G a fifth *above*
middle-C, to distinguish it, say, from the C a
fourth below.

Then there is my reference just now to the two
G's on either side of middle-C, along with
my reference to middle-C itself, in order to
distinguish that C from every other C there is.
This repetition of note letters reflects the
second topographical fact in our perception of
notes: the phenomenon of the octave. For while we
distinguish notes by their difference in pitch,
this difference reaches a kind of limit at the
interval called the "octave." At this interval,
the notes sound the same, despite their difference
in pitch, and are thus given the same letter as
name. Exactly *why* we hear this sameness is hard
to say: Aristotle attributed it to a perception of
the whole number ratio two-to-one; while Victor
Zuckerkandl deems it a miracle. But however it
happens, the sameness we hear in notes, once their
difference in pitch reaches the octave, in effect
contains that difference. If we pass beyond it, we
don't encounter new notes, but only new instances,
higher or lower, of old notes. The octave thus
turns the axis of height, along which notes are
arranged by pitch, into a kind of circumference,
which continues to trace their increase or
decrease in pitch without end, but always to the
same place again.

Yet this image, of notes now arranged into a
circumference by the octave, is not yet an image
of the space in which music moves. For it only
comprehends the change in pitch involved, as we
might conceive this change to carry us *along* the
circumference. But in hearing a melody, we again
hear not only a change in pitch, but a change of
place *within* the change in pitch, such as the
leap at the start of "Twinkle, Twinkle", from the
one-tone to the five-tone. And this description
reflects another pair of topographical facts in
our perception of notes, once we hear these notes
in a musical context.  The first such fact is that
we hear movement from note to note, without having
to hear any notes between. So in "Twinkle,
Twinkle", we hear a leap from the one-tone to the
five-, without having to hear the two-, three-,
and four-tone first. And to hear them first
would not complete the leap, as if to fill it in,
but rather transform the leap into a climb.  Why
this is a fact of musical perception may be as
hard to explain as the octave. But as a
phenomenon, it seems to involve a sense of being
*oriented* in the movement we hear from note to
note. It is as if we faced the note we were moving
to, and reached it as a goal, heedless of any
notes passed along the way.

The sense of being oriented among notes is even
clearer in the second topographical fact, which
involves our perception of notes in at least
those musical contexts we call *tonal*. And it is
this fact that forced me to shift from letters
to numbers, when identifying the leap
in "Twinkle, Twinkle", from what I called "the
one-tone" to what I called "the five-tone". For in
tonal musical contexts---and the name "tonal" is
derived from this fact---we will hear one note as
a kind of center, which *orients* us with respect
to the other notes we hear, as if to provide a
place from which to face them. The central note is
accordingly assigned the number "one" in analysis,
and the other notes assigned other numbers in
reference to "one". Again, why we are able to hear
a certain note as a center for other notes is
hard to say. But the phenomenon, as Zuckerkandl
would remind us, is dynamic, in an orientation
more felt than seen. We hear the central note as
central, that is, by sensing a stability in it
relative to the other notes, as if it provided a
place to to face them as a center of gravity. This
second topographical fact so informs the first:
for we then move from note to note as if under
the influence of a gravitational pull, requiring
effort to overcome, and supplying momentum in
success, in a deepened sense of having faced the
note being moved to, and reaching that note as a
goal.

If we accommodated these facts of musical
perception into the earlier image of a
circumference of notes, arranged by pitch and
bounded by octave, then we might describe it like
this: we hear the movement in a melody, as in
music more generally, as if we were *inside* that
circumference. For once we hear one note in the
melody as central, especially if we hear it as
a center of gravity, it is as if that note has
been projected *inside* this circumference from
its place along it. And this projection allows us
to move from note to note not simply *along* the
circumference, through every note between, but now
also *across* the circumference, guided by the
one note inside it as a center of orientation.
And this image so gives a geometric form to the
complete sense made by the space in which music
moves. For this is the sense in which we *inhabit*
that space. 

To be sure, the development of this sense, as
shown by the specifically *tonal* context in which
we hear one note of a melody as central, depends
on the like development of a specific form of
musical art---the art of tonality, to which we
owe the music of the West. But there would be
no such art to develop, unless the result made
a difference to what we could hear; and in this
case, to what we could inhabit in what we hear.
And much of tonal music's development can be
explained as a deduction from the features
of a place we inhabit. 

I spell this thought out briefly, in one example,
for those familiar with this development. If we
truly inhabited the space in which music moves, it
seems we should not be simply fixed at a single
center of orientation. We should rather be able
move that center, carrying it with us from place
to place. And move it we can---once tonal music
developed the device of modulation, to carry
us from key to key. We might also expect the
movement of that center to happen along an axis
of depth, away and back, not just to distinguish
it from the up-and-down movement between notes
along an axis of height, but also from a sense
of perspective, which implicitly belongs to our
sense of orientation when we inhabit a place.
And so we do move away and back---once tonal 
music developed the harmony out of polyphony
that modulation relies upon. We might further
expect the movement of the center to clarify our
sense, as I described this above, of the forces
felt at work in such a space. And clarified they
are---once the use of modulation effectively
reduced the modes of chant to the major-minor
scale. We might finally expect the movement of the
center to deepen our sense that we inhabit *one*
space, which *contains* the places moved between,
rather than many spaces distinguished and divided
by those places. And deepened it is---once the use
of modulation forced upon the tuning of a scale
the leveling of equal temperament, restricting the
notes of *any* key to the notes in *every* key,
and thereby placing "the whole of tonal space," as
Roger Scruton has strikingly put it, "within reach
of its every occupant."[^fn-1]

[^fn-1]: Roger Scruton, *The Aesthetics of Music*, p. 244.

Along with this deduction of tonal
music's development from the features of a
space we inhabit, comes a plausible if simple
measure of the greatness in a tonal musical work. The
greater it is, the deeper it carries us into
the space of music's movement. And by that measure
of inhabitance, the best demonstration of the
complete sense this space can make, is found not
in the account I have just given of it, but rather
in those masterpieces of tonal music---such as
Beethoven's *Eroica*---where this space
is explored to a kind of limit, in the conquest of
it.

***

But so much, then, for *my* account of the kind of
sense this space seems to make. It is time to show
why it also makes a kind of nonsense, despite my
account, and all the masterpieces of tonal music
notwithstanding.


##### The nonsense it makes. [nonsense] 

To see this, we can start by now comparing
the movement we hear in music, with motion as
we observe this more generally. Consider, for
example, the difference between the movement of
a melody, like "Twinkle, Twinkle" again, and the
motion of our hand in following that melody, as
if to conduct it. We could say that both rise and
fall, and do so not just in time but in space,
through a discernible change of place. But there
is a difference. For as I discussed earlier,
we hear the change of place in the melody, such
as the leap from the one-tone to the five-tone in
"Twinkle, Twinkle", without having to hear any
tones between. The movement happens, so we might
say, *discretely*. By contrast, we see the hand's
change of place happen *continuously*, from place
to place through *all* the places between. And
this continuity would seem a necessary feature
of its motion. For if our hand got from place to
place discretely, like the melody did, skipping
places along the way, then it would look to us as
if our hand reached each place not by motion, but
rather by magic. Or at least we'd be tempted
to think there was something in the space where
the motion occurred, beyond *just space*, that
was interrupting the motion, disrupting the
continuity it would otherwise have. But
this is one reason, then, to think there
isn't really a space for the melody to move in.
For if there were, then it would allow the melody
to move in it continuously rather than discretely.

But this reflects another difference
between the movement of the melody and the motion
of our hand in following it. And this difference
involves the matter of identity rather than
continuity. For the melody is *composed* of the
notes it moves between, while our hand is not
composed of the places it moves between. And
this explains at once why the melody has to move
discretely. It has to move discretely, because it
has *to become* what it is. And this means passing
through only those notes that compose it, and that
distinguish it, thus composed, from any other
melody. But then the melody can only *be* what
it is by becoming so, over an interval of time.
And in this sense, the melody is temporal rather
than spatial, with an identity in time rather than
space. But this is then another reason to think
that there isn't really a space for the melody to
move in. For if there were, then it would allow
the melody to possess an identity in space; which
is to say, it would allow the melody to *be* what
it is in space without having to become so, and to
remain what it is, unchanged, through every change
of place.

But here is perhaps a stronger way to put the
nonsense: If there really were a space for the
melody to move in, then there would be a melody
to hear, in the space where we hear it move.
But there isn't. We hear the leap in "Twinkle,
Twinkle", for example, without hearing anything
making the leap. For we hear this leap being made
between unleaping notes, and hear nothing further
to which we might attribute the leap. And this
seems true for music in general. We hear a
movement being made between unmoving notes, but
nothing further to which we might attribute the
movement. So we hear movement, but nothing making
the movement. Yet how, in that case, could there
*be* any movement to hear? And what could be
making it?

Yet this is only the start of the nonsense. And
the end of it implicates our very inhabitance of
the space in question. We can see this through
an objection to the analysis I just gave. True,
the objection runs, we have a sense of the space
in which motion ordinarily occurs, that we cannot
apply to the movement of music. For applying it
makes nonsense of the movement, by depriving
this movement of any object to which it might
be attributed. But what follows from this?
Perhaps only that the space music moves in is
not ordinary, but extraordinary. And this is
one way to understand my earlier defense of
the sense---the complete sense---made by this
space. For this was not an observed sense of
space, but rather an inhabited sense of it. The sense,
for example, in which we *face* the note being
moved to, and reach it as a goal. So if there
*is* a space for music to move in, which makes
sense of the movement, then this space will have
to be conceived from within, as a matter of
inhabitance, rather than from without, as a matter
of observation.

Well, fair enough. But this makes the nonsense
of such a space even easier to see. For what
is it, finally, that makes an inhabited sense
of space extraordinary rather than ordinary?
Here is one answer---the answer, for example,
that Heidegger might give. An inhabited sense of
space is extraordinary, in not stopping short
of totality. That is, our inhabited sense of
space implicitly includes everything there is,
known or unknown; anything captured in the word
"Being". For it is beings, finally, that we take
ourselves to be surrounded by, and our own being
that provides the place from which to encounter
them. This is why, despite our sometimes talking
as if there were more than one world, and even
more than one world we might inhabit, we can also
talk intelligibly, in a simpler yet deeper way,
of *the* world, as if there were only one. And it
is our being-in-the-world, on this answer, that
grounds our inhabited sense of space.


But what happens, then, when our inhabited sense
of space is divided? ---For example, between
sleeping and dreaming, where it seems we inhabit
two spaces at once? We resolve the division,
evidently, by conferring worldhood on only one
such space, taking it *to contain* the other
such space. That is, we credit only one such
space with the totality, and thus the reality,
of inhabitance, and regard the other space as
merely part of this totality. The credit we give
to its own totality, then, is the credit we give
to a dream. We still inhabit the dream---indeed
more alertly than we inhabit the
bedroom in which we dream, and often with a sense
that everything is put at stake in the dream, in
a matter of life or death. But in waking from the
dream, we prove it to be part of a larger space of
inhabitance. And this gives the dream's apparent
totality the status of mere appearance; and our
inhabitance of it, the form of an illusion. To our
relief, or perhaps our regret, what happened to us
in the dream, didn't really happen after all.

But if this is so, then it gives us reason to
suspect the very same thing of the space we
inhabit when hearing music move. The space may
well be illusory, making all the sense---but
also all the nonsense---of a dream. And in that
case, the greater the work of music, the deeper
it carries us into the dream. We hear the sound
of Beethoven's *Eroica* surge forth in a concert
hall, seeming to making an entire world shake.
Yet the musicians barely move by comparison,
while the notes they play move not at all. And we
concert-goers stay glued to our seats---entranced.
And once the work is finished, in a triumph of
conclusiveness, we are released from the trance
in a daze---and the desire, perhaps, to have
remained. For we leave the concert hall likely
finding the world we truly inhabit unchanged by
what we heard, and nothing comparable to its
conclusiveness in the life we have to live.

This, then, is what I take to be the problem with
our talking as if music moved. Talking that way
fails to distinguish our experience of music from
a dream, in which nothing we experience really
happens.

#### II. The importance of the problem. [part two] 

As I said at the start of my lecture, I also take
this problem to be important. To explain why, I
want to discuss this problem again, but now as a
problem not simply with our experience of music,
but more generally, with our experience of the
world. For we talk not just as if
music moved, but as if *anything* moved. Yet this
too involves a kind of nonsense, known since the
time of Parmenides and Zeno. And it proves to be
the same kind of nonsense we encountered in the
movement of music.

To see this, recall my earlier analysis of why
there really isn't a space for a melody to move
in. For the melody, in this respect, is temporal
rather than spatial. It is composed of the places,
or notes, it moves between, and can only be what
it is by becoming so. So there isn't a space,
strictly speaking, for the melody to move in,
with the continuity or identity of truly spatial
things, like our hand in following that melody.

Fair enough. But while our hand may be spatial
in this respect, the *motion* of our hand is
temporal, just like the melody. In a sense, it
too is composed of the places moved between, and
can only be what it is by becoming so. But this
implies, on the earlier analysis, that there
isn't really a space for our hand to move in, or
indeed for anything to move in. There is only a
space for it to be contained in, and to occupy,
over the course of its motion, at every place
composing that motion. Space only contains the
motion's path, not the motion itself. 

But here again is perhaps a stronger way to put
the nonsense. If there really were a space for
our hand to move in, then there would be a hand
to see, in the space where we see it move. But
there isn't. All we see is this motion being made
from place to unmoving place, by something that
occupies each such place. We see nothing further,
to which we might attribute *the motion* between
places, rather than just *the occupancy* of those
places. So we see motion, but nothing making the
motion. Yet how, in that case, could there *be*
any motion to see? And what could be making it?

One answer, the kind Zeno might give, is that
there *isn't* any motion to see. When we think we
see something move, all we really see is that it
occupies different places at different times. And
the appearance of motion in this, is something
like the appearance of motion on a movie screen,
or in a flip book, from a succession of images,
each of a single place and time, that happens
too rapidly for us to detect. But this kind of
answer leads to a second answer, found for example
in mathematical calculus, where there *is* a
motion to see. When we see something move on
this answer, all we indeed see is that something
occupies different places at different times.
Still, it can be proved that there are more such
places---infinitely more, in fact---than we could
ever arrange from one to the next. The places are
many enough, that is, to form a *real* continuum,
beyond the mere appearance of one in a rapid
enough succession from one place to the next. And
this makes for a real continuity in the motion we
see, giving it all the reality it needs.

There is a sense, however, in which this second
answer misses the point. For the continuity in
question belongs to the motion's path rather than
to the motion itself. And the way this
path is proved to form a continuum---for example,
in Dedekind---is by analogy to a line, undivided
by time, where every point upon it is present at
once. But it seems we only have the
proper analogy for the continuum of a motion rather
than its path when we
conceive this line divided by time, where only one
point upon it is ever present at once---the point
right now, so to speak. But how can a line prove
continuous, if it is made of only one point at a
time?

The second answer so leads to a third answer,
more philosophical than mathematical, which is
found explicitly in Bergson and implicitly, I
think, in Aristotle. This answer is distinguished
from the first answer in taking the motion we
see to be real, and from the second answer in
taking this reality to involve more than just the
continuity of the motion's path. But the promise
of this answer comes at a price: for it embraces
the nonsense that makes the problem a problem. On
this answer, that is, there is indeed nothing to
see, in the space where we see anything move. And
this is because the space where we see anything
move, is the space where the motion belongs to us,
rather than to anything we might see outside us.
So there *is* a motion to see, when *we* are the
ones making it.

Motion, in other words, occurs in the space we
inhabit, rather than in the space we observe.
For in the space we observe, we see only the
continuous path of a motion, occupied at every
place by the thing that moves. But in the space we
inhabit, we see the motion itself, which is not
simply continuous, but indivisible. The motion
in this indivisible sense stretches from the
beginning of its path to the end in a single
bound, as if the entire path were a single place
for the moving thing to occupy. And we know this
indivisibility when moving ourselves. For in
that case, we face the end of our motion at the
beginning of it, and reach the end as a goal,
heedless of any places along the way---just like
in the movement of a melody. And the path we trace
in reaching that goal can be divided only by our
changing the goal, in a motion now different from
what it was, but again indivisible. This too is
like the movement in a melody, since only further
notes can divide the distance from note to note,
but thereby produce a new melody out of the old
one, in a movement thus indivisible.  

But what should we make of this answer? It
makes the same appeal to our inhabited sense
of space that we encountered before in making
sense of the movement in music, only now to make
sense of motion as such. But does it have the same
problem? That is, can we know, or show, that we
aren't dreaming when we see anything move? 

The question put this generally might seem absurd.
After all, to suppose we *were* dreaming when
seeing anything move, would mean suspecting
something illusory now about our inhabitance of
*the world*, not just so-called other worlds, such
as dreams in the ordinary sense, or music, that we
might plausibly find illusory in their proving 
*contained* in the world, mere parts of that
totality.

But there is good reason to suspect something
close to illusory even about our inhabitance
of the world. And it explains why a question
like "Are we dreaming right now?" has been
raised in philosophy---for example, by
Descartes. For while we may not be dreaming when
we see anything move, there is arguably nothing in
our inhabitance of the world to prove it. And we
lack this proof, so the argument goes, precisely
because we inhabit the world rather merely observe
it.

To see why this argument is worth considering,
consider, first, a striking fact about optical
illusions, such as the look of a stick
half-plunged in water, and seemingly half-bent
by it. Our knowing the stick stays straight does
nothing to dispel the illusion. But why? One
answer is that there is nothing *in* the illusion
to *tell* us it's an illusion, and if there were,
then the illusion wouldn't be an illusion. We so
remain *in* the illusion, or inhabit it, as a
matter of perception, even if we stand outside the
illusion, or merely observe it, as a matter of
knowledge.

Something like this is also at work in dreams,
taking "dreams" again in the ordinary sense. For
our dreams so often contain implausible or even
impossible events, not to mention the sense in
which all its events, once we wake up, prove
unreal. So why did they seem so real in the dream?
Again, one answer is that there is nothing in a
dream, no matter how implausible or impossible,
to tell us we are dreaming, and if there were,
then we wouldn't be dreaming. So we
inhabit the dream rather than merely observe it.
It is only when something in the dream wakes us
up from it, and puts us outside the dream to
observe it, that we can know it for the dream it
is.

We can give this same answer to the question of why
our experience of music would still seem so real,
even if we became convinced---say, by my lecture
tonight---that it was only a dream. For there is
nothing *in* the music to tell us so, even if
there is *an account* of the music to tell us so.
And again, this is because we hear music as music
only by inhabiting it, past the point of any
account we might give of it.

This answer, then, points to perhaps the most
decisive, if negative, feature of our inhabitance
of the world. There is nothing we might encounter
in the world---motion, for example---to tell us
the encounter is illusory. And if there were, then
we wouldn't be having the encounter. So for all we
know, we might be dreaming. Arguing against this
prospect, to be sure, is our sense that this is
indeed the world we inhabit; our sense, in other
words, that we are surrounded by beings
rather than seemings, and that we encounter these
beings from a being rather than seeming of our
own. But this sense can never be
decisive. For the cost of inhabiting the world, on
this answer, is to be past the point of knowing
whether this inhabitance is but a dream.

This, then, is what I take to be the importance of
the problem with our talking as if music moved.
For it illustrates a more general problem, with
our talking as if anything moved. Talking that
way fails to distinguish our experience of the
world from a dream, in which nothing we experience
really happens.

And one measure of this problem's importance, as
well as one solution to it in effect, is found
in how we talk when *explaining* the world we
experience. For then we talk as if our inhabitance
of the world is indeed a dream, of a kind there
is no waking up from. Or to put this Cartesian
legacy of scientific discourse a different way:
the terms in which we explain the world, as a
matter of observation, are not the terms in
which we encounter the world, as a matter of
inhabitance---and in many cases could *never*
be the terms of such an encounter, such as in
quantum mechanics. Yet we take this discrepancy as
a sign that the world has indeed been explained
rather than erased. This is why we look for
an explanation of our encounter with music,
not in Beethoven's *Eroica*, but rather in the
physicist's account of wave phenomena, or the
neuroscientist's account of brain patterns, or the
biologist's account of evolutionary adaptations,
or even the Nietzschean's account of a sickness
in the soul. We credit these accounts as attempts
to explain our encounter with music, despite the
fact we could never encounter music as music in
such terms. So why the credit? Because we find
nothing self-justifying in the encounter itself:
it may well be only a dream. And to solve this
problem, we explain the dream away. That is, we
explain the encounter by avoiding any appeal to
the sense the encounter makes only from a place
of inhabitance---and often by challenging that
sense. 


#### Conclusion

There is, however, a different solution to the
problem. And I wish to conclude my lecture by
presenting this solution in brief. We might
call it Heideggerian to distinguish it from the
Cartesian solution just mentioned. In this
solution, not having a proof that
our inhabitance of the world is real, is 
all the proof for it that we need. There is
nothing to tell us we might dreaming, true; but
this is because we aren't.

This solution already sounds unpromising. After
all, there is nothing in *a dream* to tell us
we are dreaming, but we are. On this solution,
however, it turns out we aren't, at least as
a matter of inhabitance. For any space of
inhabitance is real, on this account, precisely
because it can be inhabited. And this means we
are *always* surrounded by beings rather than
seemings, and always encounter them from a being
rather than seeming of our own, whether we find
ourselves in a dream, in a symphony, or in the
world that contains them. True, we have reason to
think otherwise, again since these smaller spaces
are contained in a larger space that proves their
own totality to be illusory. But this assumes
that any space of inhabitance lies, indeed, in
space. Yet on this solution, it is only a space
of observation that lies in space. Any space of
inhabitance lies instead in time.

Perhaps this solution now sounds even more
unpromising. For how can there be any room in
time for a space of inhabitance, when the only
part of time that ever exists is 'the right now',
that instant between the no-longer and not-yet
at the seeming size of a point? Still, this very
fact about time's evanescence turns the illusion
of movement in music and motion more generally
into an object of wonder if not astonishment. For
according to our earlier analysis, motion is what
it is, only in time. But if time exists only
at a point, then how could we ever encounter a
temporal whole like motion---even in the form of
an illusion? How could we even dream that we hear
the rise and fall of a melody, or see the rise and
fall of our hand in following it?

It is in offering an answer to this question that
the solution starts to look more promising. And
the answer is this. The 'right now' may be no
larger than a point. But this is still room enough
to establish a space of inhabitance, in providing
a center of orientation. And this is the center
from which the not-yet lies ahead of us, the
no-longer lies behind us, and the now is always
with us. And in being always at this center,
we are always in the world, even when we find
ourselves in a dream, or a symphony. We inhabit
even these smaller spaces from the same center of
orientation, where the not-yet is ahead of us as a
matter of expectation, the no-longer is behind us
as a matter of memory, and the now is always with
us as a matter of attention. It is in these terms,
temporal terms, that any space of observation
becomes a place of inhabitance.

It is also in these temporal terms that any place
of inhabitance is real rather than illusory.
For this center of orientation, despite being a
mere point in time, comprehends a totality in
time for each of us---from a beginning in birth
that no one else can share, to an end in death
that no one else can know. This is the center,
then, from which the not-yet ahead of us is a
future to face; the no-longer behind us is a
past to bear; and the now always with us is a
present at stake. So in being always at this
center, at a point of totality as it were, we are
always in a world that is real, even when we find
ourselves in a dream or symphony. We inhabit
even these smaller spaces from the same center
of orientation, with a future to face, a past to
bear, and a present at stake. This is why we can
be released from their spell without having
recovered from it. And in this sense,
again temporal rather than spatial, we are not
carried from the world by a dream or symphony, but
concentrated in it. 

Or to summarize this solution to the problem
in conclusion: we can only talk as
if anything moved, much less as if music moved,
insofar as the space we inhabit in talking that
way makes complete sense of what we say, without
any room for nonsense. And this is the space we
inhabit right now: the space made possible by
time. Thank you.

<!-- [Mention how we talk, in explaining the world, as
if our inhabitance of it is a dream---a legacy
of Descartes] For the terms in which we explain
it, as a matter of observation, are not the
terms in which we encounter it, as a matter of
inhabitance,, and in many cases could never be the
terms in which we encounter it it. We may explain
music, for example, in terms of wave phenomena,
or neural patterns, or evolutionary adaptations;
but it is not in these terms that we encounter
it. But we take this as a sign that something has
been explained rather than erased. mathematical
physics, for example, that we hear music because
o here is no way, for example, to hear music
or even pitch in a vibration of sound, if only
because we never encounter sound as sound ; for we
encounter that vibration of , since we encounter
that vibration of sound in effect challenge that
inhabitance rather than embrace it. conceive the
world as a placein a way that challenges our
inhabitance of it. 

[make Cartesian solution more brief.] But to conclude my lecture, I want to present two
solutions to this problem in brief. For these
solutions, I think, show what is finally at stake
in the problem. The first solution I will call
Cartesian. In this solution, we attempt to escape
our inhabitance of the world, from the doubt that
it might be only a dream, and the worry that there
is no waking up from it. And we attempt to escape
this inhabitance, by trying to stand outside it,
adopting a point of view beyond it---the view
from nowhere, so to speak---where the world is
observed rather than inhabited. Or to put this
escape in perhaps more plausible terms: we try to
understand the world, describe the world, explain
the world, in terms that make no appeal to our
inhabitance of it. 

(Refer back to beginning.) These are the terms we live with. (Much of inhabitance language
is a metaphor, while language

in light of the aim of
liberal education. as a problem of education. think the problem is important. (Start with liberal
education point. Opinion about world not a deep
enough point)

I think the problem *is* important. And to
begin to explain why, I want to offer an argument 
that the problem with our talking as if music
moved, is actually for the following claim: the problem with our talking as if
music moved, turns out to be the problem with our
talking as if *anything* moved. And the sense in
which our experience of music might well be only a
dream, turns out to be the sense in which our
experience of anything might well be only a dream. in failing to
distinguish our experience of music from a dream,
we are actually failing to distinguish our
experience of anything from a dream. 

But why is this a problem worth
describing, much less resolving? What makes it
important?  we
should care about, especially those of us with
little interest would this be an important
problem? is this an important problem?
And if it is important, then why? 

I called what I just described *a suspicion*: the
suspicion that music doesn't really move, and that
we are dreaming, in effect, when we hear it move.
And if music must move to be music at all, then
the suspicion is that we are dreaming when we hear
music, period, when
we hear it move, we are dreaming. we are dreaming when hearing music
move, and that it doesn't really move.  that we are then dreaming in hearing
music at all, and if music is only music if it moves, about
music, Nothing in what I just described, of course,
*proves* that the description is true. I haven't
yet given an argument that we are dreaming, in any
recognizable, Perhaps we
aren't ne of what I have just suggested, of course,
*proves* that the suggestion is true.  I haven't
shown that we are dreaming in any sense when
hearing music move; or, if music is only music
when it moves, that we are dreaming when hearing
music at all. But I think this suggestion gives 
a graphic sense of indeed in hearing music
at all, if music is only music when it moves. But I think the suggestion
gives  Let this suffice, then, as an account of the
problem with our talking as if music moved. What
of its importance? Should we care that we might be
dreaming when hearing music move---or indeed, when
hearing music at all, if music is only music when
it moves? Perhaps this problem is only a problem
for lovers of music, in the prospect that what
they love is nothing more than an illusion, and
thus without any place in a serious life---which
is to say, a life in which we refuse to be guided
or satisfied by illusions. But those of us without
that love likely suspected as much, in taking
music, when it isn't simply an intrusion upon
life, as a distraction, or at least diversion,
from life.

But I now want to argue that this response to the
problem mistakes the nature and extent of it;
and that the problem has an importance for all
of us. And by "all of us", I mean those of us
here tonight, who are serious enough about life
to have pursued the kind of education---liberal
education---that promises us the freedom required
by a serious life. What this freedom entails may
be hard to say, or even to know. But it seems
safe enough to say that the freedom entailed, is
at least a freedom from just the sort of illusion
that music may induce---the illusion of a dream.
For we could say that being free, in the sense
required by a serious life, at least means being
awake. But dreams, in giving us the illusion
of being awake, keep us asleep. Or to speak of
this sleep less metaphorically, we could say
that dreams involve the illusion of
inhabitance, which means they have the power to make us
not simply encounter what isn't really there, but
to embrace it, in a satisfaction with the illusion
that causes what *is* really there to vanish,
in effect, along with any hope of a life that
dispels the illusion.

But if this is so, then the aim of liberal
education, under one description, would be to wake
us up, not simply from sleep, but from the kind of
sleep in which we seem awake to ourselves. Liberal
education, then, would aim to wake us up from
a dream. (Put Heideggerian language here.) (Revise from here. If music is a dream --- but in fact inhabitance itself has all the features of the dream, and there is no way to be woken from it. What this means for liberal education I will conclude with.) And if one such dream is the movement
we hear in a succession of unmoving sounds,
then at least this is what a liberal education
should wake us up from, and dispel the illusion
we call music. We should then study a work of
Beethoven's or Bach's, if at all, not as if
it contained inexpressible truth, but something
closer to inexcusable falsehood, which convicted
its composer of sophistry, or sorcery, under the show of
profundity. (That we don't study Bach). So one thing at stake is whether it is
a dream, and if so, how would we know. An answer has
been given, to a question hardly asked)-->

<!-- Leftover stuff

But since I assume
rather more interest in music in my account of
the problem itself, and that account is rather
long, I will say this much now
about my sense of its importance, in case it
helps anyone sit through the first part of my
lecture more expectantly, or at least patiently.
While I present this specifically as a problem
in our experience of music, I take it to be a
problem, more generally, in our experience of the
world. And at stake in the problem, on that level,
is the prospect of our freedom in the world.
So understood---or at least as I will want to
understand it---the problem thus poses a challenge
to liberal education---indeed, to the very idea
of liberal education. But more on that in [Part
Two][part two].

Or alternative formulation: if the movement we hear
in music is an illusion, then freedom is an illusion;
and if freedom is illusion, then liberal education
is an illusion. music doesn't move,
then we can't be free, and if we can't be free,
then any education that promises to make us free
is an illusion.-->


<!-- Stuff to maybe include 

Then, in moving to issue with space, make it one
of inhabitance, where we seem in two worlds at
once.

is that we will hear
one note of in a melody
as a kind of center, which *orients* us with
respect to the other notes in the melody, as if
to provide a place from which to face them. The
central note is accordingly assigned the number
1 for the purposes of melodic analysis, and the
other notes assigned other numbers---2, 3, and so
on---making implicit reference to 1. The two facts seem to be related: we
hear melody as central, again as if from a place
to face the other notes, we also move that way
between notes in the melody, as if woves us from
one note to another, on the circumference I just
described, by putting us, as it were, *inside* the
circumference, not by carrying us *along* it, in
a mere change of pitch, but rather *across* it,
in a change of place. , and across it by being
put inside the circumference, in what is then an
image of inhabitance. To see this, consider again
the beginning of "Twinkle, Twinkle" as I described
this above, where we hear a leap from the ˆ1 tone
to the ˆ5 tone *within* the change of pitch from
middle C to G. The shift from letters to numbers
in our classification of notes We classify notes
this way by number, not merely by letter, to
reflect yet another pair of topographical facts
in our perception of notes, both involving a
sense of orientation, once we hear these notes in
a musical context like a melody. The first such
fact is that we hear one note in a melody as a
kind of center, which *orients* us with respect to
the other notes in the melody, as if to provide a
place from which to face them. The central note is
accordingly assigned the number 1 for the purposes
of melodic analysis, and the other notes assigned
other numbers---2, 3, and so on---making implicit
reference to 1. The second topographical fact is
that we hear movement from one note to another
without having to hear any notes between. We hear
a leap from the ˆ1 tone to the ˆ5 in "Twinkle,
Twinkle," for example, without having to hear
the ˆ2,ˆ3, or ˆ4 tones first; and indeed to hear
them first would turn the leap into a climb. This
second fact, like the first, involves a sense of
orientation produced by musical contexts like
melodies produce: so just as we then hear one note
in the melody as central, again as if from a place
to face the other notes, so we also move that way
between notes, as if we faced the note we were
moving to, and then reached it as a goal, without
needing to take account of any in-between notes
silently passed along the way. The two facts seem
to be related: we hear melody as central, again as
if from a place to face the other notes, we also
move that way between notes in the melody, as if
we

the orientation
provided by that note, across the circumference
and through that note, from one note to another
subsequently made, will *not* then be made *along* the
circumference, or from one note to another through every
note between.  The movement will rather be made through none
of the notes between in being made *across* the
circumference, through its central point, in a geometric
reflection of the way we seem to inhabit musical space in
hearing music move, from one note to the other not through
every note between, but rather through the orientation
provided by a central such note.

This is perhaps as far as this image of a circumference
should be pressed for the purposes , but that we
find ourselves inside of, A geometric image of inhabitance. Inhabitance, perspective,
mobility, even equal temperament. Make sure to discuss
these in terms of the experience that makes them viable
developments in the history of music.
(Keep facing language. Leap as if
making it ourselves, rather than watching it from
the side. Relates to Zuckerkandl point, that the
orientation comes with gravity, stability.) In
this example, the central note is middle C, thus
given the number 1. hat central notein a melodic
scale by number recall the melodic scale I invoked
to describe the initial change of place in the
melody:

it.)

sense the move from note to note isn't through

melodic scale. Same place again can be heard
as a center, as if projected to a point inside
the circumference, and which orients us with
respect to that circumference. as if this place
were projected to a center. .(Mention specific
example of middle C and G.) This introduces ,

us along this circumference, we hear a change of
place, For again, we hearOnce the notes on that
circumference are selected and arrangedFor in
reaching the same place againFor as indicated by
a melodic scale, reaching the same place again
means hearing it as a center that organizes the
notes in between, as if as a projection from this
place. And Zuckerkandl points out, our perception
of this center is not static or merely spatial,
but dynamic, as if the center possossed gravity.
And the center can change, it is mobile; while
harmony contributes perspective. Then there is
equal temperament, which in Scruton's words There
is then (revise from here: longest distance return
to same, so circumferential, then talk about being
centered and feeling weight or gravity, then
move on the center moving through modulation and
harmony giving depth, perhaps equal temperment) a
topography so real as to be inhabited.

Our sense of the place we inhabit is not that it is merely
a part of some larger whole, but rather than it is finally
that whole.

But what kind of space could this be, that allows
music to move? And where is it, in relation to
the space we ordinarily inhabit? When we find
ourselves in a symphony hall, for example, with
musicians seated in their chairs, yet hear
the sounds of Beethoven's *Eroica*
surging forth, where has the music taken us? Out of the
symphony hall? Deeper into the symphony hall? Are we in our
heads? has the music taken us? and hear
Beethoven's *Eroica* surge forth even as the
musicians playing it are comparatively motionless
in their chairs, ,In paragraph where space doesn't make sense, point out
that where is space, if outside of us? 
which means (talk about occupying a place) that
notes are not simply arranged by pitch in a
relative position of lower and higher; they also
form extremitiesgives notes a sense of place
beyond higher and lower, Thus the sameness we
hear giving to notes an octave apart a deeper
sense of place that comprehends their relative
position of higher or lower. ; while still hearing
a difference in pitch. Indeed, this difference is
maximal rather than minimal: it is not the pitches
we can barely distinguish as lower or higher to
one another that prove to sound the same in this
sense; but rather the pitches we most easily so
distinguish. So the sameness we hear establishes
a sense of place that comprehends the higher
and lower; beyond higher and lower; different
pitches can occupy this place in sounding the
same, despite their distance from one another
in pitch. Moreover, this distance---to which we
give the name "octave"---turns out to be maximal
rather than minimal; the sense of place is more
like a circumference that contains the pitches of
a melody. In a still-more important feature of
this perception, the sameness we hear in these
pitches corresponds to a difference between them
that is maximal rather than minimal, measured
by the octave. So the sense of place is of a
circumference rather than a latitude or longitude.

  And since the sameness we hear is that
different pitches can occupy, beyond the
positions that distinguishes them by pitch.
the position that their difference in pitch
determines., which pitches can occupy rather than
merely determine. can be occupied by different
pitches. the sameness we hear comes with an
implicit sense of place, occupied by entities
otherwise separated by pitch. of sameness
seems to be a sense of place, occupied by many
pitches indefinitely many pitches. at a kind of
extremity of distance, measured by the octave,
from one such pitch to the next, And the sense
of place comes with a kind of circumference,
which contains every other pitch that doesn't so
sound the same, since the place is occupied by
pitches that are otherwise most different rather
than least different, in a kind of containing of
all the pitches between, the sense of place is a
sense of circumference.

implicit sense o. and to which we thus give the

the point of musical theory in this sense is to
account for a topography of perception---and
more generally, the possibility that we can
have an altogether discerning musical ear while
remaining all but illiterate about what we
hear, yet--is one of the only more evidence for
how much sense the space of musical motion can
make. For the point of musical theory, in this
respect, is not to construct that space but
rather to illuminate it, in something like the
way a forest is illuminated once you know the
names of the trees in it, giving us the words and
concepts to say we already hear, when we hear
music in a succession of sounds.(revise from

pitch by places, then by scale in recurrence

pitches in question, at least by ear, under the
description that nowadays distinguishes them,
in terms of the frequency at which a wavelength
vibrates. For frequency in this sense is able to
define a pitch by abstracting from any sense of
its place. But for those few of us with perfect
pitch, even the recognition of pitch will come
with an implicit sense of place, according to
where we hear middle C, followed by the G a

example, when we hear middle C followed by the G

This distinguishes the movement in music from
the movement in mere sound, There is no such
change in place that we hear in a mere sound,
like a siren, whose rise and fall involves only
a change in pitch over time. Unlike the rise and
fall of a siren, for example, where we hear a
continuous change of pitch over time, the rise
and fall of melodythis movement as a change in
place. (Say what places are.) And this change in
place distinguishes music from mere sound, which
changes in time. , we could say that when we hear
music move---at least of any kind that includes
not just rhythm, but melody and harmony---we
hear the movement as a change in place, and we
can be more or less exact about the places in
question. So, we don't hear a melody just rise
and fall; we hear it rise and fall in moving
from one tone to another in a scale of such
tones---say, from the 1 tone up to the 5, then
down again to the 1. Similarly, we don't hear
the harmony supporting that melody just depart
and return; we hear it depart and return by
moving from one chord to another in a scale of
such chords---say, from tonic to dominant and
back again to tonic. It is this exactness about
the space in which music moves that allows it
to be composed and encoded on a musical score,
even though the score itself is soundless and
motionless. It is also this exactness that allows
music to be analyzed and studied, rather than
merely heard and appreciated. And one way of
understanding the history of music, at least in
the West, is as a progress in such exactness And
that music happens in so articulable a space is
what seems to distinguishes it from mere sound,
which happens, by contrast, in time rather than
space. it is the space of music in this sense
that distinguishes it from mere sound, which by
contrast happens only in time.

between the so-called degrees of a melodic or
harmonic scale. (Put the next bit later, to
suggest music is an illusion.)

So again, on the one hand, the motion we hear in
music would seem to be real enough to happen in
a completely accountable kind of space. Yet on
the other hand, (motionless score; motionless
orchestra; and that space otherwise allows
for continuity of motion and identity through
time precluded by musical space; then maybe
mention hand, not following the motion but
supplying it, that music moves in moving us.)

(What do previous paragraphs show about the
reality of space.) The fact that music can be so
immediately distinguished from sound

And how could it be otherwise? After all, if
music happens in time, and time is a measure of
motion, then music, it would seem, is a motion
in turn; and for lovers of music, among the most
meaningful such motions in their lives.

not just in time, but in space. The motion is
a form of *locomotion*, or motion from place
to place. But then again, time is not the only
measure of motion, at least if by "motion", we
mean *locomotion*, or a motion from place to
place. Of motion in this sense, one measure is
time, but another is space. ---The space, for
example, in which a bird rises and falls in
flight. Or the space, by seeming resemblance,
in which a melody rises and falls; and more
generally, in which music---at least of any
kind that involves not just beats but tones,
not just rhythm but melody and harmony---indeed
moves, from place to place, rising and falling,
departing and returning, very like the motion of
a bird in flight.

Transition paragraph: mention that Zuckerkandl
discusses this in Sound and Symbol even if not
in Sense of Music, and it strikes me as an
important issue, perhaps the most significant
issue, in understanding music, and its place in
the liberal arts. Slavery and free. (Make new
paragraph here: about how music also happens in
space as a movement; music is not simply change.
Perhaps use motion picture paragraph to indicate
difference in the illusoriness of music and
illusoriness of motion pictures. Organize replies
to evident illusoriness of motion in terms of
motion being an illusion, being an appearance,
and being a reality, in rough correspondence to
the distinction made in Plato's Sophist. Also
mention music as a kind of liberal art.)

(Rough organization: music as illusion, (and
being serious about music means being serious
about the possibility that it may be a waste
of time). but problem with difference between
illusion and appearance, such as difference
between movies and paintings. Thus music
as appearance, but problem with unexamined
assumptions about motion. Music as reality.)

(End with showing, how through compound ratio,
time is not simply one-dimensional, or even an
added dimension.)

But there may be less reason to accept this
conclusion than to deny it; and to wonder, then,
how meaningful music finally is. For the meaning
of music in this sense, upon reflection, would
seem to depend on the illusion of movement rather
than the reality of it, in something like the
way that a motion picture, despite its name,
only seems to move, being nothing in truth but
a series of photographs, or frames, on a strip
of plastic. Music, too, may be nothing in truth
but the series of notes that we find indelibly
and immovably marked in a score. Once these
notes are played in succession, just as once
those frames are shown in succession, they give
us the inescapable impression of something's
moving, even though nothing is moving. No frame
or note, after all, could be said to move itself
in the succession, or somehow fuse with the
next frame or note to render that succession a
genuine transition. Yet we sense transition in
the succession all the same, in what is then a
mere image of motion, without a similarly moving
origin.

And the absence of actual motion in music would
seem still more radical, if we now *contrast* the
notes that compose it with the frames of a motion
picture. For those frames, at least in the usual
case, are of a scene in which the actors really
move, taken and projected rapidly enough to
reproduce that real motion upon a screen, so far
as the eye can tell. But there is no such scene
of real motion that the notes of music could be
said to record and reproduce for the ear. And
the scene of real motion closest to the music
we hear---the musicians playing it---is all but
motionless compared to the music being played,
as the players stay seated in their chairs, for
example, while the sound of Beethoven's *Eroica*
surges forth. Indeed, it would seem necessary
for the notes in a piece of music to be *unlike*
the frames in a motion picture, if we are to
hear movement in their succession, at least the
movement we identify as music. For the succession
should not happen rapidly enough to blur the
distinction between notes, lest the music vanish
in a siren of noise; and the notes themselves
should refer only, or at least principally, to
one another in that succession, rather than to
any scene beyond, lest the music vanish again, in
a kind of picture-painting.

And even this much analysis of the difference
between our sense of motion generally and our
sense of motion in music depends on our taking the
notes of music not simply as sounds, occupying
particular moments of time, but also as tones,
occupying particular places in space---in this
case, the places in space that allow us to say the
melody rises and falls. But what kind of places in
space are this? What kind of space is this? And
*where* is it? Surely not where the singer of the
melody is, or as if the melody could rise and fall
in the same sky inhabited by the bird. But if the
space in which music moves is not the same space
in which we encounter motion otherwise, then why
credit our talk of the motion in music with any
but a metaphorical sense? it looks as if we are
speaking only metaphorically in saying that music
moves.-->
