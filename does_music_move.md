Does music move? 

Well, yes---if by "move", we meant the way that we
can indeed be *moved* by music: from table-taps to
tangos to tears.

Or yes again---if by "music", we meant the
vibrations of sound that allow us to hear what a
musician plays: from instrument to air to ear.

But the question becomes less easy to answer,
if we ask it of music and movement in a more
elementary sense. ---The sense in which we might
say, of a rhythm, that it quickens or slows; of
a melody, that it rises and falls; of a harmony,
that it departs and returns. And suppose we say
all this about the first movement of a symphony,
not thinking twice about calling what we hear a
"movement." For we talk as if we hear just that
in the music---movement---and as if any piece
of music indeed moves itself in moving us. And
how could it be otherwise? After all, if time is
a measure or even medium of motion, and music
happens in time, then music must be a motion; and
for lovers of music, among the most meaningful
such motions in their lives.

But there may be less reason to accept this
conclusion than to deny it; and cause to wonder, then,
how meaningful music finally is. For the meaning
of music in this sense, upon reflection, would
seem to depend on the illusion of movement rather
than the reality of it, in something like the way
that a motion picture, despite its name, only
seems to move, being nothing in truth but a series
of photographs, or frames, on a strip of plastic.
Music, too, may be nothing in truth but the series
of notes that we find indelibly and immovably
marked in a score. Once these notes are played
in succession, just as once those frames are
shown in succession, they give us the inescapable
impression of something's moving, even though
nothing is moving. No frame or note, after all,
could be said to move itself in the succession,
or somehow fuse with the next frame or note to
render the succession a genuine transition. Yet we
sense transition in the succession all the same,
in what is then a mere image of motion, without a
similarly moving origin.

And the absence of actual motion in music would
seem still more radical, if we now contrast the
notes that compose it with the frames of a
motion picture. For those frames, at least in
the usual case, are of a scene in which the actors
really move, taken and projected rapidly enough to
reproduce that real motion upon a screen, so far
as the eye can tell. But there is no such scene
of real motion that the notes of music could be
said to record and reproduce for the ear. The scene of
real motion closest to the music we hear---the
musicians playing it---is all but motionless
compared to the music being played, as the players
stay seated in their chairs, for example, while
the sound of Beethoven's *Eroica* surges forth. And it
would seem necessary for the notes in a piece
of music to be *unlike* the frames in a
motion picture, if we are to hear movement in their
succession, at least the movement we identify as
music. For the succession should not happen
rapidly enough to blur the distinction between
notes, lest the music vanish in a siren of
noise; and the notes themselves should refer only,
or at least principally, to one another in that
succession, rather than to any scene
beyond, lest the music vanish again, in a kind of
picture-painting.

But we could also leave any comparison to motion
pictures aside, and simply contrast the most
salient features in our experience of motion
otherwise with their absence in our experience
of music. (Use rising and falling of a bird
instead.) For in seeing my friend walking towards
me, for example, I can identify the thing moving
as my friend, and other things nearby---such
as the sidewalk he is walking on---as unmoving
relative to my friend; while supposing that
his movement towards me is a matter not simply
of being in different spots on the sidewalk at
different times, but of being carried from spot
to spot---continuously---by his walking. Yet in
hearing a melody rise and fall, none of these
features are straightforwardly apparent. I just
identified the thing moving as the melody; but
what I more strictly hear, if it could be called
a motion at all, is a motion from one note of
the melody to the next. What we are calling the
"melody", then, is no already-formed object, like
my walking friend, that similarly rises and falls.
Nor do we hear any unmoving such object nearby the
melody, like the sidewalk I can see beneath my
friend, relative to which the melody could be said
to move. We might try to identify such an object
in each note of the melody, perhaps by analogy to
each spot on the sidewalk; but then we are left
with nothing to identify in the melody itself that
rises and falls, and what exactly is *moving*
in the melody, over each unmoving note in turn,
becomes even harder to say. And in this case we
also confront a final (mention continuity problem;
then space problem, insofar as analysis treats the notes
as places in space).


kseem like a continuously varying sound, cause a
draw the following contrast with motion pictures.
For the series, since film photographs a motion
and the score (or recording) isn't photograph
the musicians moving. (They stay still.) (Maybe
mention lack of rapidity.) We can reach this same
conclusion about music even leaving the analogy to
motion pictures aside, by considering .
