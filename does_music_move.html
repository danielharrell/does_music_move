<h4 id="intro">Introduction.</h4>

<p>Does music move?</p>

<p>Well, yes&#8212;if by &#8220;music&#8221;, we meant the vibrations
of sound that allow us to hear what a musician
plays: from instrument to air to ear.</p>

<p>Or yes again&#8212;if by &#8220;move&#8221;, we meant the way we
can be moved by music: from table-taps to
tangos to tears.</p>

<p>But the question is harder to answer, if we ask it
of music&#8217;s movement in a more elementary sense.
&#8212;The sense in which we might say, of a rhythm,
that it quickens and slows; or of a melody,
that it rises and falls; or of a harmony, that
it departs and returns. And suppose we say all
this about the first movement of a symphony, not
thinking twice about calling this a &#8220;movement&#8221;.
For we talk as if we hear just that in the
symphony&#8212;movement&#8212;and as if any piece of music
moves itself in moving us.</p>

<p>Our talking this way has a point. For if we didn&#8217;t
hear music move, would we hear it at all? Without
movement, music would seem no more than a series
of sounds.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> But there is a problem with
our talking this way, despite its point. And this
is the problem I discuss in my lecture tonight. In
its <a href="#partone">first part</a>, I explain what I take
the problem to be. In its <a href="#parttwo">second part</a>,
I explain why I take the problem to be important.
In its <a href="#partthree">final part</a>, I offer two
solutions to the problem, in the attempt to deepen
our sense of it.</p>

<h4 id="partone">The nature of the problem.</h4>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p>So what is the problem with our talking as if
music moved? The problem, in a word, is space:
the space in which we hear music move. &#8212;The
space that allows it to quicken and slow, rise
and fall, depart and return. For this space
makes something close to <a href="#sense">complete sense</a>
on the one hand, yet something closer to
<a href="#nonsense">nonsense</a> on the other.<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a></p>

<h5 id="sense">The sense it makes.</h5>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p>To see the sense it makes, we can start by
comparing the movement we hear in music, with
the variation we hear in sounds more generally.
Consider, for example, the difference between a
melody and a siren. Both involve a change in pitch
over time. And we might say, in that respect, that
both rise and fall. But unlike the siren, the
melody does this in a kind of articulated space,
usually conceived as a scale. And this space gives
us the impression of movement, from one place to
the next. We sense a change of place, in other
words, within the melody&#8217;s change in pitch, as
if having caused it.</p>

<p>As illustration, suppose we hear the beginning
of &#8220;Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star&#8221; on middle-C,
where C is followed by the G a fifth above.
Within this change in pitch, we hear a change of
place&#8212;from the first degree of a melodic scale
to the fifth; or otherwise put, from the one-tone
to the five-tone.<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> And this change of
place gives us the impression of a movement having
caused the change in pitch: in this case, of a
leap from the one-tone to the five-, causing C to
be followed by G.</p>

<p>Now suppose we hear the siren rise from C to G.
We don&#8217;t hear this rise happen in the articulated
space of a scale; and the continuity of the
rise would seem to preclude it, since the places
in a scale are discrete. But this means we are
given no impression of movement by the siren&#8217;s
change in pitch, from one place to the next. It&#8217;s
as if the siren rises only in time, not in space.
True, we can see, or at least infer, a change of
place behind the siren&#8217;s change in pitch, in
the fire engine, say, that produced it. But we
don&#8217;t hear any change of place within the change
in pitch, that might replace the fire engine as
cause, and turn what we hear as a signal into what
we could hear as a melody.</p>

<p>Of course, we may not know about a musical scale,
to account for the change of place we hear in
the melody. But this ignorance is only more
evidence for the sense made by the space of
music&#8217;s movement, in its own terms. And it
reflects a striking fact about what it means to
understand music. For we can develop an altogether
discerning musical ear, while remaining all but
illiterate about what we hear. And becoming
literate, by studying music theory, underlines
the sense music makes even without this theory.
For the topography of this theory&#8212;such as
the melodic scale&#8212;is more discovered than
invented, and in the discovery, more inhabited
than observed. One sign of this is the way we are
moved by music; for we are thus moved inwardly, in
the space we inhabit as selves. But I will now try
to show this more explicitly. And my conclusion
will be that it is because we inhabit
what we hear, in hearing music move, that the
space of this movement makes complete sense. The
completeness in this sense has to do with the
experience of inhabitance.</p>

<p>To begin to see this, recall the terms I used for
the melody &#8220;Twinkle, Twinkle.&#8221; I identified its
first two pitches by note&#8212;middle-C and the G a
fifth above. This identification depends on two
topographical facts in our perception of notes,
even outside a musical context. The first such
fact is that we hear a difference in pitch,
whereby one note is distinguished from another, as
a difference in relative place: one note sounding
higher, the other note lower. This perception is
also transitive: if one note sounds higher than a
second, and the second higher than a third, then
the first will also sound higher than the third.
Our perception of pitch difference so gives every
note its own position along an axis of height.
Hence my talk of the G a fifth above middle-C,
to distinguish it, say, from the G a fourth below.</p>

<p>Then there is my reference just now to the two G&#8217;s
on either side of middle-C, along with my
reference to middle-C itself, in order to
distinguish that C from every other C there is.
This repetition of note letters reflects the
second topographical fact in our perception of
notes: the phenomenon of the octave. For while we
distinguish notes by their difference in pitch,
this difference reaches a kind of limit at the
interval called the &#8220;octave&#8221;, where the notes
sound the same, despite their difference in pitch,
and are thus given the same letter as name.
Exactly why we hear this sameness is hard to
say: Aristotle ascribed it to a perception of
the whole number ratio two-to-one; while Victor
Zuckerkandl calls it a miracle.<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a> But
however it happens, the sameness we hear in notes,
once their difference in pitch reaches the octave,
in effect contains that difference. If we pass
beyond it, we don&#8217;t encounter new notes, but only
new instances, higher or lower, of old notes. The
octave thus turns the axis of height, along which
notes are arranged by pitch, into a kind of
circumference, which continues to trace their
increase or decrease in pitch without end, but
always to the same place again.</p>

<p>Yet this image, of notes now arranged into a
circumference by the octave, is not yet an image
of the space in which music moves. For it only
comprehends the change in pitch involved, as we
might conceive this change to carry us along
the circumference. But in hearing a melody, we
again hear a change of place within the change
in pitch, such as the leap from the one-tone to
the five- at the start of &#8220;Twinkle, Twinkle…&#8221;.
And this description reflects another pair of
topographical facts in our perception of notes,
once we hear these notes in a musical context. The
first such fact is that we hear movement from note
to note, without having to hear any notes between.
So in &#8220;Twinkle, Twinkle…&#8221;, we hear a leap from the
one-tone to the five-, without having to hear the
two-, three-, and four-tone first. And to hear
them first would not complete the leap, as if to
fill it in, but rather transform the leap into a
climb. Why this is a fact of musical perception
may be as hard to explain as the octave. But as a
phenomenon, it seems to involve a sense of being
oriented in the movement we hear from note to
note. It&#8217;s as if we faced the note we were moving
to, and reached it as a goal, heedless of any
notes on the way.<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a></p>

<p>The sense of being oriented among notes is even
clearer in the second topographical fact, which
involves our perception of notes in musical
contexts we call tonal. It is this fact that
forced me to shift from letters to numbers, when
identifying the leap in &#8220;Twinkle, Twinkle…&#8221; from
the one-tone to the five-. For in tonal musical
contexts&#8212;and the name &#8220;tonal&#8221; is derived from
this fact&#8212;we will hear one note as a kind of
center, which orients us with respect to the
other notes we hear, as if to provide a place
from which to face them. The central note is
so assigned the number &#8220;one&#8221; in analysis,
and the other notes assigned other numbers in
reference to &#8220;one&#8221;. Again, why we can hear
a certain note as central is
hard to say. But the phenomenon, as Zuckerkandl
would remind us, is dynamic, in an orientation
more felt than seen. We hear the central note as
central, that is, by sensing a stability in it
relative to the other notes, as if it provided a
place to face them as a center of gravity. This
second topographical fact so informs the first:
for we then move from note to note as if under
the influence of a gravitational pull, requiring
effort to overcome, and supplying momentum in
success, in a deepened sense of having faced the
note being moved to, and reaching that note as a
goal.</p>

<p>We can accommodate these facts of musical
perception into the earlier image of a
circumference of notes, arranged by pitch and
bounded by the octave. For once we hear one
note in the melody as central, especially if
we hear it as a center of gravity, it&#8217;s as if
we were projected with that note inside the
circumference. And this projection allows us to
move from note to note not simply along the
circumference, through every note between, but now
across the circumference, guided by the one note
inside it as a center of orientation. This image
so gives a geometric form to the complete sense
made by the space in which music moves. For this
is the sense in which we inhabit that space.</p>

<p>To be sure, the development of this sense, as
shown by the specifically tonal context in which
we hear one note of a melody as central, depends
on the like development of a specific form of
musical art&#8212;the art of tonality, to which we
owe the music of the West. But there would be
no such art to develop, unless the result made
a difference to what we could hear; and in this
case, to what we could inhabit in what we hear.
And much of tonal music&#8217;s development can be
explained as a deduction from the features of a
place we inhabit.</p>

<p>I spell this thought out briefly, in one example,
for those familiar with this development. If
we inhabited the space of music&#8217;s movement, it
seems we should not simply be fixed at a single
center of orientation. We should rather be able
move that center, carrying it with us from place
to place. And move it we can&#8212;once tonal music
developed the device of modulation, to carry
us from key to key. We might also expect the
movement of that center to happen along an axis
of depth, away-and-back, not just to distinguish
it from the up-and-down movement between notes
along an axis of height, but also from a sense of
perspective, which implicitly belongs to our sense
of orientation when we inhabit a place. And so we
do move away and back&#8212;once tonal music developed
the harmony out of polyphony that modulation
relies upon. We might further expect the movement
of the center to clarify our sense, as I described
this above, of the gravity felt at work in such
a space. And clarified it is&#8212;once the use of
modulation effectively reduced the modes of chant
to the major-minor scale. We might finally expect
the movement of the center to deepen our sense
that we inhabit one space, which contains the
places moved between, rather than many spaces
distinguished and divided by those places. And
deepened it is&#8212;once the use of modulation forced
upon the tuning of a scale the leveling of equal
temperament. For this restricts the notes of any
key to the notes in every key. And as Roger
Scruton has strikingly described the result, equal
temperament thus &#8220;places the whole of tonal space
within reach of its every occupant.&#8221;<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a></p>

<p>Along with this deduction comes a plausible
measure of the greatness in a musical work. The
greater it is, the deeper it carries us into the
space of music&#8217;s movement. And by that measure
of inhabitance, the best demonstration of the
complete sense this space can make, is found not
in my account, but rather in those masterpieces
of music&#8212;such as Beethoven&#8217;s <em>Eroica</em>&#8212;where
this space is explored to a kind of limit, in the
conquest of it.<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a></p>

<h5 id="nonsense">The nonsense it makes.</h5>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p>But as I said, the space of music&#8217;s movement
also makes a kind of nonsense. To see this, we
can start by now comparing the movement we hear
in music, with motion as we observe this more
generally. Consider, for example, the difference
between the movement of a melody, like &#8220;Twinkle,
Twinkle…&#8221; again, and the motion of our hand in
following that melody, as if to conduct it. We
could say that both rise and fall, and do so not
just in time but in space, through a discernible
change of place. But there is a difference. For as
I mentioned earlier, we hear the change of place
in the melody, such as the leap from the one-tone
to the five-tone in &#8220;Twinkle, Twinkle…&#8221;, without
having to hear any places between. The movement
happens discretely. By contrast, we see the
hand&#8217;s change of place happen continuously, from
place to place through all the places between.
And this continuity would seem a necessary feature
of its motion. For if our hand got from place to
place discretely, like the melody did, skipping
places along the way, then it would look to us as
if our hand reached each place not by motion, but
rather by magic. Or at least we&#8217;d be tempted to
think there was something in the space where the
motion occurred, beyond just space, that was
interrupting the motion, disrupting the continuity
it would otherwise have. But this is one reason,
then, to think there isn&#8217;t really a space for the
melody to move in. For if there were, then it
would allow the melody to move in it continuously
rather than discretely.</p>

<p>But this reflects another difference&#8212;involving
identity rather than continuity&#8212;between the
movement of the melody and the motion of our hand
in following it. For the melody is composed of
the notes it moves between, while our hand is
not composed of the places it moves between. And
this explains at once why the melody has to move
discretely. For it has to become what it is.
And this means passing through only those notes
that compose it, and that distinguish it, thus
composed, from any other melody. But then the
melody can only be what it is by becoming so,
over an interval of time. And in this sense, the
melody is temporal rather than spatial, with an
identity in time rather than space.<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a>
But this is then another reason to think that
there isn&#8217;t really a space for the melody to move
in. For if there were, then it would allow the
melody to possess an identity in space; that is,
it would allow the melody to be what it is in
space without having to become so, and to remain
what it is, unchanged, through every change of
place.</p>

<p>But here is perhaps a stronger way to put the
nonsense: If there really were a space for the
melody to move in, then there would be a melody
to hear, in the space where we hear it move.
But there isn&#8217;t. We hear the leap in &#8220;Twinkle,
Twinkle&#8221;, for example, without hearing anything
making the leap. For we hear this leap being made
between unleaping notes, but nothing further to
which we might attribute the leap. And this is
true for music in general&#8212;a fact reflected in
the unmoving notes on a musical score. Once the
score is performed, we hear a movement being made
between the unmoving notes, but nothing further to
which we might attribute the movement. So we hear
movement, but nothing making the movement. Yet
how, in that case, could there be any movement
to hear? And what could be making it?</p>

<p>Yet this is only the start of the nonsense. And
the end of it implicates our very inhabitance of
the space in question. We can see this through an
objection to the analysis I just gave. True, the
objection runs, we have a sense of the space in
which motion ordinarily occurs, that we cannot
apply to the movement of music. For applying it
makes nonsense of the movement, by depriving
this movement of any object to which it might be
attributed. But what follows from this? Perhaps
only that the space in which music moves, is
not ordinary, but extraordinary. And this is
one way to understand my earlier defense of the
sense&#8212;the complete sense&#8212;made by this space.
For this was not an observed sense of space,
but rather an inhabited sense of space. The sense,
for example, in which we face the note being
moved to, and reach it as a goal. So if there
is a space for music to move in, which makes
sense of the movement, then this space will have
to be conceived from within, as a matter of
inhabitance, rather than from without, as a matter
of observation.</p>

<p>The objection has a point. But it makes
the nonsense even clearer. For what is it,
finally, that makes an inhabited sense of space
extraordinary? Here is one answer. An inhabited
sense of space is extraordinary, in not stopping
short of totality. That is, our inhabited sense
of space implicitly includes everything there is,
known or unknown; anything captured in the word
&#8220;Being&#8221;. For it is beings, finally, that we take
ourselves to be surrounded by, and our own being
that provides the place from which to face them.
This is why, despite our sometimes talking as if
there were more than one world, and even more
than one world we might inhabit, we can also talk
intelligibly of the world, as if there were only
one. And it is our being-in-one-world, on this
answer, that grounds our inhabited sense of space.</p>

<p>But what happens, then, when our inhabited sense
of space is divided? &#8212;For example, between
sleeping and dreaming, where it seems we inhabit
two spaces at once? We resolve the division,
evidently, by conferring worldhood on only one
such space, taking it to contain the other
such space. That is, we credit only one
space with the totality, and thus the reality, of
inhabitance, and regard the other space as merely
part of this totality. The credit we give to its
own totality, then, is the credit we give to a
dream. We still inhabit the dream&#8212;and more
alertly than we inhabit the bedroom in which we
dream, often with a sense that everything is
put at stake in the dream, in a matter of life
or death. But in waking from the dream, we prove
it part of a larger space of inhabitance.
And this gives the dream&#8217;s apparent totality the
status of mere appearance; and our inhabitance of
it, the form of an illusion. To our relief, or
perhaps our regret, what happened to us in the
dream, didn&#8217;t really happen after all.</p>

<p>But if this is so, then it gives us reason to
suspect the very same thing of the space we
inhabit when hearing music move. The space may
well be illusory, making all the sense&#8212;but
also all the nonsense&#8212;of a dream. And in that
case, the greater the work of music, the deeper
it carries us into the dream. We hear the sound
of Beethoven&#8217;s <em>Eroica</em> surge forth in a concert
hall, seeming to make the whole world shake. Yet
the musicians barely move by comparison, while
the notes they play move not at all. And we
concert-goers stay glued to our seats&#8212;entranced.
And once the work is finished, in a triumph of
conclusiveness, we are released from the trance
in a daze&#8212;and the desire, perhaps, to have
remained. For we leave the concert hall likely
finding the world we truly inhabit unchanged by
what we heard, and nothing comparable to its
conclusiveness in the life we have to live.</p>

<p>This, then, is what I take to be the problem with
our talking as if music moved. Talking that way
fails to distinguish our experience of music from
a dream, in which nothing we experience really
happens.</p>

<h4 id="parttwo">The importance of the problem.</h4>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p>I also take this problem to be important. To
explain why, I discuss this problem again, but
now as a problem not simply with our experience
of music, but more generally, with our experience
of the world. For we talk not just as if music
moved, but as if anything moved. Yet this too
involves a kind of nonsense, known since the time
of Parmenides. And it proves to be the same kind
of nonsense we encountered in the movement of
music.</p>

<h5 id="nonsense_motion">The nonsense of motion as such.</h5>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p>To see this, recall my earlier analysis of why
there really isn&#8217;t a space for a melody to move
in. For the melody, in this respect, is temporal
rather than spatial. It is composed of the places
it moves between, and can only be what it is by
becoming so. So there isn&#8217;t a space, strictly
speaking, for the melody to move in, with the
continuity or identity of truly spatial things,
like our hand in following that melody.</p>

<p>But while our hand may be spatial
in this respect, the motion of our hand is
temporal, just like the melody. In a sense, it
too is composed of the places moved between, and
can only be what it is by becoming so. But this
implies, on the earlier analysis, that there isn&#8217;t
really a space for our hand to move in, or for
anything to move in. There is only a space for it
to be contained in, and to occupy, over the course
of its motion, at every place composing that
motion. Space, in other words, contains only
the path of the motion, not the motion itself.</p>

<p>But here again is perhaps a stronger way to put
the nonsense. If there really were a space for
our hand to move in, then there would be a hand
to see, in the space where we see it move. But
there isn&#8217;t. All we see is the motion being made
from place to unmoving place, by something that
occupies each such place. We see nothing further,
to which we might attribute the motion between
places, rather than just the occupancy of those
places. So we see motion, but nothing making the
motion. Yet how, in that case, could there be
any motion to see? And what could be making it?</p>

<h5 id="responses">Three responses to the nonsense.</h5>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p>One answer, the kind Zeno might give, is that
there isn&#8217;t any motion to see.<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a> When we
think we see something move, all we really see is
that it occupies different places at different
times. And the appearance of motion in this, is
something like the appearance of motion on a movie
screen, or in a flip book, from a succession of
images, each of a single place and time, that
happens too rapidly for us to detect. But this
first answer leads to a second answer, found for
example in calculus, where there is a motion
to see.<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[11]</a> When we see something move on
this answer, all we see, again, is that something occupies
different places at different times. Still, it can
be proved that there are more such places than
we could ever arrange from one to the next. The
places are many enough, that is, to form a real
continuum, beyond the mere appearance of one. And
this makes for a real continuity in the motion we
see, giving it all the reality it needs.</p>

<p>There is a sense, however, in which this second
answer misses the point. For the continuity in
question belongs to the motion&#8217;s path rather than
to the motion itself. And the way this path is
proved continuous&#8212;for example, in Dedekind&#8212;is
by analogy to a line, undivided by time, where
every place upon it is present at once.<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a>
But the proper analogy for the
motion itself would seem to be a line divided by
time, where only one place upon it is ever present
at once&#8212;the point right now, so to speak. But
how could such a line prove continuous, if it is
made of only one point at a time?</p>

<p>The second answer so leads to a third answer,
more philosophical than mathematical, and found,
for example, in Bergson.<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[13]</a> This answer
is distinguished from the first answer in taking
the motion we see to be real, and from the second
answer in taking this reality to involve more than
just the continuity of the motion&#8217;s path. But the
promise of this answer comes at a price: for it
embraces the nonsense that makes the problem a
problem. On this answer, that is, there is
nothing to see, in the space where we see anything
move. And this is because the space where we see
anything move, is the space where the motion
belongs to us, rather than to anything we might
see outside us. So there is a motion to see,
when we are the ones making it.</p>

<p>On this answer, in other words, motion occurs in
the space we inhabit, rather than in the space
we observe. In the space we observe, we see
only the continuous path of a motion, occupied
at every place by the thing that moves. But in
the space we inhabit, we see the motion itself,
which is not simply continuous, but indivisible.
The motion in this indivisible sense stretches
from the beginning of its path to the end in a
single bound, as if the entire path were a single
place for the moving thing to occupy. And we know
this indivisibility when moving ourselves. For
in that case, we face the end of our motion at
the beginning of it, and reach the end as a goal,
heedless of any places on the way&#8212;just like in
the movement of a melody. And the path we trace
in reaching that goal can be divided only by our
changing the goal, in a motion now different from
what it was, but again indivisible. This too is
like the movement in a melody; for only further
notes can divide the distance from note to note,
but thereby produce a new melody out of the old
one, showing the movement between notes in any one
melody to be indivisible.</p>

<h5 id="remains">The nonsense remains.</h5>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p>But what should we make of this answer? It makes
the same appeal to our inhabited sense of space
that we encountered before in making sense of
the movement in music, only now to make sense of
motion as such. But does it have the same problem?
That is, can we show, or know, that we aren&#8217;t
dreaming when we see anything move?</p>

<p>The question put this generally might seem
absurd. After all, to suppose we were
dreaming when seeing anything move, would
mean suspecting something illusory about our
inhabitance of the world. But there is reason
for this suspicion. And it explains why a
question like &#8220;Are we dreaming right now?&#8221; has
been raised in the history of thought&#8212;for example, by
Descartes.<a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[14]</a> For while we might not be
dreaming right now, there is arguably nothing in
our inhabitance of the world to prove it. And we
lack this proof, so the argument goes,
because we inhabit the world. If we had the proof,
we would no longer inhabit it, but merely
observe it.</p>

<p>To see why this argument is worth taking seriously,
consider, first, a striking fact about optical
illusions, such as the look of a stick
half-plunged in water, and seemingly half-bent
by it. Our knowing the stick stays straight does
nothing to dispel the illusion. But why? One
answer is that there is nothing in the illusion
to tell us it&#8217;s an illusion, and if there were,
then the illusion wouldn&#8217;t be an illusion. We so
remain in the illusion, or inhabit it, as a
matter of perception, even if we stand outside the
illusion, or merely observe it, as a matter of
knowledge.</p>

<p>This could also be said of dreams, taking &#8220;dreams&#8221;
in the ordinary sense. For our dreams so often
contain implausible or even impossible events,
not to mention the sense in which all its events,
once we wake up, prove unreal. So why did they
seem so real in the dream? Again, one answer is
that there is nothing in the dream, no matter
how implausible or impossible, to tell us we are
dreaming, and if there were, then we wouldn&#8217;t
be dreaming. Not being able to tell is what it
means to inhabit the dream. And it is only when
something in the dream wakes us up from it, and
puts us outside the dream to observe it, that we
can know it for the dream that it is.</p>

<p>We can give this same answer to the question of
why our experience of music would still seem so
real, even if we were convinced&#8212;say, by my
lecture tonight&#8212;that it was only a dream. For
there is nothing in the music to tell us so,
even if there is some account of the music to tell
us so. And this is what it means to inhabit the
music, past the point of any account we might give
of it.</p>

<p>This answer, then, points to perhaps the most
decisive, if negative, feature of our inhabitance
of the world. There is nothing we might encounter
in the world&#8212;motion, for example&#8212;to tell us
the encounter is illusory. For if there were, then
we wouldn&#8217;t be having the encounter. So for all we
know, we might be dreaming. Arguing against this
prospect, perhaps, is our sense that this is
the world, not just some world. But this sense can
never be decisive. For the cost of inhabiting the
world, on this answer, is to be past the point of
telling whether it involves any illusions.</p>

<p>This, then, is what I take to be the importance of
the problem with our talking as if music moved.
For it illustrates a more general problem, with
our talking as if anything moved. Talking that
way fails to distinguish our experience of the
world from a dream, in which nothing we experience
really happens.</p>

<h4 id="partthree">Two solutions to the problem.</h4>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p>I conclude my lecture with two solutions to this
problem, in the attempt to deepen our sense of it.
They are incompatible solutions, since they give
contrary answers, in effect, to the question &#8220;Are
we dreaming right now?&#8221;</p>

<h5 id="science">The solution of science.</h5>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p>In the first solution, the answer to this question
is yes, we are dreaming right now. And the
solution, then, is to make no appeal to the dream,
when we try to understand the world.
We try to understand the world, in other words,
by making no appeal to the sense it makes only
from a place of inhabitance&#8212;or even better, by
challenging that sense.</p>

<p>Thus described, the solution may sound
unpromising; for how can we avoid this appeal?
Still, this is one way to characterize how we have
tried to understand the world since Descartes. And
we might call this first solution the solution
of science. A central example of it is
the way we try to understand motion, by means
of calculus rather than introspection. But more
generally, the terms in which we explain the
world, as a matter of observation, are not the
terms in which we encounter the world, as a
matter of inhabitance&#8212;and in many cases, such
as quantum physics, could never be the terms of
such an encounter. Yet we take this discrepancy as
a sign that the world has been explained rather
than erased. And we look for an explanation of
our encounter with music, not in Beethoven&#8217;s
<em>Eroica</em>, but rather in the mathematician&#8217;s
account of numerical ratios, or the physicist&#8217;s
account of wave phenomena, or the neuroscientist&#8217;s
account of brain patterns, or the biologist&#8217;s
account of evolutionary adaptations, or even the
Nietzschean&#8217;s account of a sickness in the soul.
Despite the fact we don&#8217;t encounter music as
music in such terms, we credit these accounts as
attempts to explain that encounter. Which suggests
that we find nothing self-justifying in the
encounter itself; nothing there to tell us what&#8217;s
really going on&#8212;as if the encounter were
just a dream. &#8212;Or, according to this first
solution to that problem, as if the encounter were
what required explanation, rather than what
provided explanation.</p>

<h5 id="philosophy">The solution of philosophy.</h5>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<p>This brings me to the second solution.
My sketch of it will remind many of you of
Heidegger.<a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[15]</a> But I call it the
solution of philosophy. For it embraces our
inhabitance of the world in a way that I suspect
always distinguishes a philosophic understanding
of the world from a scientific one. In this
solution, then, the answer to the question &#8220;Are we
dreaming right now?&#8221; is no. There may be nothing to
tell us this&#8212;true&#8212;but this doesn&#8217;t mean we
might be dreaming; it rather means we aren&#8217;t.</p>

<p>This solution may already sound unpromising.
After all, there may be nothing in a dream to
tell us we are dreaming, but we are. On this
solution, however, it turns out we aren&#8217;t, at
least as a matter of inhabitance. For any space
of inhabitance is real, because it can
be inhabited. And this means we are always
surrounded by beings, and always face them from
a being of our own, whether we find ourselves
in a dream, in a symphony, or in the world that
contains them. True, we have reason to think
otherwise, in thinking that these smaller spaces are
contained in a larger space that proves their own
totality to be illusory. But this assumes that
any space of inhabitance lies in space. Yet it is
only a space of observation, on this solution,
that lies in space. Any space of inhabitance lies
instead in time.</p>

<p>Perhaps this solution now sounds even more
unpromising. For how can there be any room in time
for a space of inhabitance, when the only part of
time that ever exists is &#8216;right now&#8217;, that instant
between the no-longer and not-yet at the seeming
size of a point? Still, this very fact about
time&#8217;s evanescence turns the illusion of motion
into an object of wonder, if not astonishment.
For according to our earlier analysis, motion is
what it is, only in time. But if time exists only
at a point, then how could we ever encounter a
temporal whole like motion&#8212;even in the form of
an illusion? How could we even dream that we hear
the rise and fall of a melody, or see the rise and
fall of our hand in following it?</p>

<p>It is in offering an answer to this question, that
the solution starts to look more promising. And
the answer is this. &#8216;Right now&#8217; may be no larger
than a point. But this is still room enough to
establish a space of inhabitance, in providing a
center of orientation. And this is the center from
which the not-yet lies ahead of us, the no-longer
lies behind us, and the right-now is always
with us. And in being always at this center,
we are always in the world, even when we find
ourselves in a dream, or a symphony. We inhabit
even these smaller spaces from the same center of
orientation, where the not-yet is ahead of us as
a matter of expectation, the no-longer is behind
us as a matter of memory, and the right-now is
always with us as a matter of attention. And in
these terms, temporal terms, any space of
observation becomes a place of inhabitance.</p>

<p>It is also in these temporal terms that any place
of inhabitance is real rather than illusory. For
this center of orientation, despite being a mere
point in time, comprehends a totality of time
for each of us: from a beginning in birth that
no one else can share, to an end in death that
no one else can know, in a span of time without
remainder. This is the center, then, from which
the not-yet ahead of us is a future to face; the
no-longer behind us is a past to bear; and the
right-now always with us is a present at stake.
So in being always at this center, at a point of
totality, we are always in a world that
is real, even when we find ourselves in a dream
or symphony. We inhabit even these smaller spaces
from the same center of orientation, with a future
to face, a past to bear, and a present at stake.
This is why we can be released from their spell,
without having recovered from it. In this sense,
again temporal rather than spatial, we are not
carried from the world by a dream or symphony,
but concentrated in it. And if our inhabitance
of the world is temporal rather than
spatial, then we are surrounded by
events rather than things, to which we are open
rather than closed, making dreams and symphonies
possible, not impossible.</p>

<p>Or to summarize this second solution to the
problem in conclusion: we can only talk as if
anything moved, much less as if music moved,
insofar as the space we inhabit in talking that
way, makes complete sense of what we say, without
any room for nonsense. And this is the space we
inhabit right now: the space made possible by
time.</p>

<!-- [mention how we talk, in explaining the world, as
if our inhabitance of it is a dream---a legacy
of descartes] for the terms in which we explain
it, as a matter of observation, are not the
terms in which we encounter it, as a matter of
inhabitance,, and in many cases could never be the
terms in which we encounter it it. we may explain
music, for example, in terms of wave phenomena,
or neural patterns, or evolutionary adaptations;
but it is not in these terms that we encounter
it. but we take this as a sign that something has
been explained rather than erased. mathematical
physics, for example, that we hear music because
o here is no way, for example, to hear music
or even pitch in a vibration of sound, if only
because we never encounter sound as sound ; for we
encounter that vibration of , since we encounter
that vibration of sound in effect challenge that
inhabitance rather than embrace it. conceive the
world as a placein a way that challenges our
inhabitance of it. 

[make cartesian solution more brief.] but to conclude my lecture, i want to present two
solutions to this problem in brief. for these
solutions, i think, show what is finally at stake
in the problem. the first solution i will call
cartesian. in this solution, we attempt to escape
our inhabitance of the world, from the doubt that
it might be only a dream, and the worry that there
is no waking up from it. and we attempt to escape
this inhabitance, by trying to stand outside it,
adopting a point of view beyond it---the view
from nowhere, so to speak---where the world is
observed rather than inhabited. or to put this
escape in perhaps more plausible terms: we try to
understand the world, describe the world, explain
the world, in terms that make no appeal to our
inhabitance of it. 

(refer back to beginning.) these are the terms we live with. (much of inhabitance language
is a metaphor, while language

or more
exactly, in terms that account for a world we
could never inhabit. (liberal education). 

what if our inhabitance is not spatial, but
temporal. 
perhaps move lack of sign of illusion
to sense in which it isn't an illusion. also
mention problem of temporal wholes for science.
when i compared the rise and fall of our (present
problem first; then move on to liberal education.)

in light of the aim of
liberal education. as a problem of education. think the problem is important. (start with liberal
education point. opinion about world not a deep
enough point)

i think the problem *is* important. and to
begin to explain why, i want to offer an argument 
that the problem with our talking as if music
moved, is actually for the following claim: the problem with our talking as if
music moved, turns out to be the problem with our
talking as if *anything* moved. and the sense in
which our experience of music might well be only a
dream, turns out to be the sense in which our
experience of anything might well be only a dream. in failing to
distinguish our experience of music from a dream,
we are actually failing to distinguish our
experience of anything from a dream. 

but why is this a problem worth
describing, much less resolving? what makes it
important?  we
should care about, especially those of us with
little interest would this be an important
problem? is this an important problem?
and if it is important, then why? 

i called what i just described *a suspicion*: the
suspicion that music doesn't really move, and that
we are dreaming, in effect, when we hear it move.
and if music must move to be music at all, then
the suspicion is that we are dreaming when we hear
music, period, when
we hear it move, we are dreaming. we are dreaming when hearing music
move, and that it doesn't really move.  that we are then dreaming in hearing
music at all, and if music is only music if it moves, about
music, nothing in what i just described, of course,
*proves* that the description is true. i haven't
yet given an argument that we are dreaming, in any
recognizable, perhaps we
aren't ne of what i have just suggested, of course,
*proves* that the suggestion is true.  i haven't
shown that we are dreaming in any sense when
hearing music move; or, if music is only music
when it moves, that we are dreaming when hearing
music at all. but i think this suggestion gives 
a graphic sense of indeed in hearing music
at all, if music is only music when it moves. but i think the suggestion
gives  let this suffice, then, as an account of the
problem with our talking as if music moved. what
of its importance? should we care that we might be
dreaming when hearing music move---or indeed, when
hearing music at all, if music is only music when
it moves? perhaps this problem is only a problem
for lovers of music, in the prospect that what
they love is nothing more than an illusion, and
thus without any place in a serious life---which
is to say, a life in which we refuse to be guided
or satisfied by illusions. but those of us without
that love likely suspected as much, in taking
music, when it isn't simply an intrusion upon
life, as a distraction, or at least diversion,
from life.

but i now want to argue that this response to the
problem mistakes the nature and extent of it;
and that the problem has an importance for all
of us. and by "all of us", i mean those of us
here tonight, who are serious enough about life
to have pursued the kind of education---liberal
education---that promises us the freedom required
by a serious life. what this freedom entails may
be hard to say, or even to know. but it seems
safe enough to say that the freedom entailed, is
at least a freedom from just the sort of illusion
that music may induce---the illusion of a dream.
for we could say that being free, in the sense
required by a serious life, at least means being
awake. but dreams, in giving us the illusion
of being awake, keep us asleep. or to speak of
this sleep less metaphorically, we could say
that dreams involve the illusion of
inhabitance, which means they have the power to make us
not simply encounter what isn't really there, but
to embrace it, in a satisfaction with the illusion
that causes what *is* really there to vanish,
in effect, along with any hope of a life that
dispels the illusion.

but if this is so, then the aim of liberal
education, under one description, would be to wake
us up, not simply from sleep, but from the kind of
sleep in which we seem awake to ourselves. liberal
education, then, would aim to wake us up from
a dream. (put heideggerian language here.) (revise from here. if music is a dream --- but in fact inhabitance itself has all the features of the dream, and there is no way to be woken from it. what this means for liberal education i will conclude with.) and if one such dream is the movement
we hear in a succession of unmoving sounds,
then at least this is what a liberal education
should wake us up from, and dispel the illusion
we call music. we should then study a work of
beethoven's or bach's, if at all, not as if
it contained inexpressible truth, but something
closer to inexcusable falsehood, which convicted
its composer of sophistry, or sorcery, under the show of
profundity. (that we don't study bach). so one thing at stake is whether it is
a dream, and if so, how would we know. an answer has
been given, to a question hardly asked)

<!-- leftover stuff

but since i assume
rather more interest in music in my account of
the problem itself, and that account is rather
long, i will say this much now
about my sense of its importance, in case it
helps anyone sit through the first part of my
lecture more expectantly, or at least patiently.
while i present this specifically as a problem
in our experience of music, i take it to be a
problem, more generally, in our experience of the
world. and at stake in the problem, on that level,
is the prospect of our freedom in the world.
so understood---or at least as i will want to
understand it---the problem thus poses a challenge
to liberal education---indeed, to the very idea
of liberal education. but more on that in [part
two][part two].

or alternative formulation: if the movement we hear
in music is an illusion, then freedom is an illusion;
and if freedom is illusion, then liberal education
is an illusion. music doesn't move,
then we can't be free, and if we can't be free,
then any education that promises to make us free
is an illusion.-->

<!-- stuff to maybe include 

then, in moving to issue with space, make it one
of inhabitance, where we seem in two worlds at
once.

is that we will hear
one note of in a melody
as a kind of center, which *orients* us with
respect to the other notes in the melody, as if
to provide a place from which to face them. the
central note is accordingly assigned the number
1 for the purposes of melodic analysis, and the
other notes assigned other numbers---2, 3, and so
on---making implicit reference to 1. the two facts seem to be related: we
hear melody as central, again as if from a place
to face the other notes, we also move that way
between notes in the melody, as if woves us from
one note to another, on the circumference i just
described, by putting us, as it were, *inside* the
circumference, not by carrying us *along* it, in
a mere change of pitch, but rather *across* it,
in a change of place. , and across it by being
put inside the circumference, in what is then an
image of inhabitance. to see this, consider again
the beginning of "twinkle, twinkle" as i described
this above, where we hear a leap from the ˆ1 tone
to the ˆ5 tone *within* the change of pitch from
middle c to g. the shift from letters to numbers
in our classification of notes we classify notes
this way by number, not merely by letter, to
reflect yet another pair of topographical facts
in our perception of notes, both involving a
sense of orientation, once we hear these notes in
a musical context like a melody. the first such
fact is that we hear one note in a melody as a
kind of center, which *orients* us with respect to
the other notes in the melody, as if to provide a
place from which to face them. the central note is
accordingly assigned the number 1 for the purposes
of melodic analysis, and the other notes assigned
other numbers---2, 3, and so on---making implicit
reference to 1. the second topographical fact is
that we hear movement from one note to another
without having to hear any notes between. we hear
a leap from the ˆ1 tone to the ˆ5 in "twinkle,
twinkle," for example, without having to hear
the ˆ2,ˆ3, or ˆ4 tones first; and indeed to hear
them first would turn the leap into a climb. this
second fact, like the first, involves a sense of
orientation produced by musical contexts like
melodies produce: so just as we then hear one note
in the melody as central, again as if from a place
to face the other notes, so we also move that way
between notes, as if we faced the note we were
moving to, and then reached it as a goal, without
needing to take account of any in-between notes
silently passed along the way. the two facts seem
to be related: we hear melody as central, again as
if from a place to face the other notes, we also
move that way between notes in the melody, as if
we

the orientation
provided by that note, across the circumference
and through that note, from one note to another
subsequently made, will *not* then be made *along* the
circumference, or from one note to another through every
note between.  the movement will rather be made through none
of the notes between in being made *across* the
circumference, through its central point, in a geometric
reflection of the way we seem to inhabit musical space in
hearing music move, from one note to the other not through
every note between, but rather through the orientation
provided by a central such note.

this is perhaps as far as this image of a circumference
should be pressed for the purposes , but that we
find ourselves inside of, a geometric image of inhabitance. inhabitance, perspective,
mobility, even equal temperament. make sure to discuss
these in terms of the experience that makes them viable
developments in the history of music.
(keep facing language. leap as if
making it ourselves, rather than watching it from
the side. relates to zuckerkandl point, that the
orientation comes with gravity, stability.) in
this example, the central note is middle c, thus
given the number 1. hat central notein a melodic
scale by number recall the melodic scale i invoked
to describe the initial change of place in the
melody:

(mention how advances are not to invent space but to explore
it.)
(both in terms of center, and in the
sense the move from note to note isn't through
every note between, like the siren.) (mention
sense of leaping) ccording to the degrees in a
melodic scale. same place again can be heard
as a center, as if projected to a point inside
the circumference, and which orients us with
respect to that circumference. as if this place
were projected to a center. .(mention specific
example of middle c and g.) this introduces ,
gain, within the change of pitch that would carry
us along this circumference, we hear a change of
place, for again, we hearonce the notes on that
circumference are selected and arrangedfor in
reaching the same place againfor as indicated by
a melodic scale, reaching the same place again
means hearing it as a center that organizes the
notes in between, as if as a projection from this
place. and zuckerkandl points out, our perception
of this center is not static or merely spatial,
but dynamic, as if the center possossed gravity.
and the center can change, it is mobile; while
harmony contributes perspective. then there is
equal temperament, which in scruton's words there
is then (revise from here: longest distance return
to same, so circumferential, then talk about being
centered and feeling weight or gravity, then
move on the center moving through modulation and
harmony giving depth, perhaps equal temperment) a
topography so real as to be inhabited.

our sense of the place we inhabit is not that it is merely
a part of some larger whole, but rather than it is finally
that whole.

but what kind of space could this be, that allows
music to move? and where is it, in relation to
the space we ordinarily inhabit? when we find
ourselves in a symphony hall, for example, with
musicians seated in their chairs, yet hear
the sounds of beethoven's *eroica*
surging forth, where has the music taken us? out of the
symphony hall? deeper into the symphony hall? are we in our
heads? has the music taken us? and hear
beethoven's *eroica* surge forth even as the
musicians playing it are comparatively motionless
in their chairs, ,in paragraph where space doesn't make sense, point out
that where is space, if outside of us? 
which means (talk about occupying a place) that
notes are not simply arranged by pitch in a
relative position of lower and higher; they also
form extremitiesgives notes a sense of place
beyond higher and lower, thus the sameness we
hear giving to notes an octave apart a deeper
sense of place that comprehends their relative
position of higher or lower. ; while still hearing
a difference in pitch. indeed, this difference is
maximal rather than minimal: it is not the pitches
we can barely distinguish as lower or higher to
one another that prove to sound the same in this
sense; but rather the pitches we most easily so
distinguish. so the sameness we hear establishes
a sense of place that comprehends the higher
and lower; beyond higher and lower; different
pitches can occupy this place in sounding the
same, despite their distance from one another
in pitch. moreover, this distance---to which we
give the name "octave"---turns out to be maximal
rather than minimal; the sense of place is more
like a circumference that contains the pitches of
a melody. in a still-more important feature of
this perception, the sameness we hear in these
pitches corresponds to a difference between them
that is maximal rather than minimal, measured
by the octave. so the sense of place is of a
circumference rather than a latitude or longitude.

  and since the sameness we hear is that
different pitches can occupy, beyond the
positions that distinguishes them by pitch.
the position that their difference in pitch
determines., which pitches can occupy rather than
merely determine. can be occupied by different
pitches. the sameness we hear comes with an
implicit sense of place, occupied by entities
otherwise separated by pitch. of sameness
seems to be a sense of place, occupied by many
pitches indefinitely many pitches. at a kind of
extremity of distance, measured by the octave,
from one such pitch to the next, and the sense
of place comes with a kind of circumference,
which contains every other pitch that doesn't so
sound the same, since the place is occupied by
pitches that are otherwise most different rather
than least different, in a kind of containing of
all the pitches between, the sense of place is a
sense of circumference.

 this fact of musical perception gives an
implicit sense o. and to which we thus give the
same letter such as c as label. are thereby
grouped together under the same letter as label.
(pitches that are in different positions but
the same place. also not next to each other,
but at a kind of extremity, producing a sense
of circumference.) that we hear not just a
difference in pitch that distinguishes them, but
a sameness in this difference

pitches farthest apart, but in the same place,
as if the pitch continuum formed a kind of
circumference. (classification of pitch: same
place again; of scale; located at a kind of
home, orientation, and through modulation,
re-orientation. center of observation; of dynamic
order; force, momentum, stability, gravity,
inhabitance; also point out that what we hear
immediately is the gravity.) we introduce a first
topographical element in our usual classification

that we accommodate a first topographical element
in our usual classification of musical pitch, a

above, ---a topography, at bottom, of perception.
largely, of perception rather than conception.
the topography that we find in music theory,
the point of musical theory in this sense is to
account for a topography of perception---and
more generally, the possibility that we can
have an altogether discerning musical ear while
remaining all but illiterate about what we
hear, yet--is one of the only more evidence for
how much sense the space of musical motion can
make. for the point of musical theory, in this
respect, is not to construct that space but
rather to illuminate it, in something like the
way a forest is illuminated once you know the
names of the trees in it, giving us the words and
concepts to say we already hear, when we hear
music in a succession of sounds.(revise from
here) to have established a more or less complete
topography and vocabulary, in music theory, to
account for the change of place. admit ohave
established a more or less complete topography
and vocabulary of music theory indeed, even the
pitches themselves are for those of us with
perfect pitch, the recognition of pitch with come
with an implicit sense of place, and our as we
hear middle c followed by the g a fifth above, ,
as wthe usual way of identifying even the pitches
in question (mention usual way of dividing
pitch by places, then by scale in recurrence
that suggests a circumference to space, then by
stability, home-location, that suggests a gravity
and center, as if we inhabited it. also mention
modulation.) we almost surely can't identify the
pitches in question, at least by ear, under the
description that nowadays distinguishes them,
in terms of the frequency at which a wavelength
vibrates. for frequency in this sense is able to
define a pitch by abstracting from any sense of
its place. but for those few of us with perfect
pitch, even the recognition of pitch will come
with an implicit sense of place, according to
where we hear middle c, followed by the g a
fifth above . and in hearing pitches at the
frequencies, the pitches at frequencies of
identifying even just the pitches of the melody
will be to identify the pitches of the melody,
for example, as middle c, and when we identify
the pitches we just heard as wavn talking of
hearing the following five frequencies, instead
of saying we just heard the frequencies in
succession, we will say we just heard middle

places until below.) (start with frequency,

hearing a leap (suppress hatmarked references
until next paragraph; gravity and depth), for
example, when we hear middle c followed by the g
a fifth above. just as it means hearing a gentler
and seemingly stepwise descent, back to where we
began, when we hear that g followed in turn by
the f, e, and d in turn, before hearing middle
c again. (bring up stuff from below, then go on
to say space is clear and distinct enough to be
heard, deep enough to be explored.) movement in

the succession in time a kind of inhabitance in

this distinguishes the movement in music from
the movement in mere sound, there is no such
change in place that we hear in a mere sound,
like a siren, whose rise and fall involves only
a change in pitch over time. unlike the rise and
fall of a siren, for example, where we hear a
continuous change of pitch over time, the rise
and fall of melodythis movement as a change in
place. (say what places are.) and this change in
place distinguishes music from mere sound, which
changes in time. , we could say that when we hear
music move---at least of any kind that includes
not just rhythm, but melody and harmony---we
hear the movement as a change in place, and we
can be more or less exact about the places in
question. so, we don't hear a melody just rise
and fall; we hear it rise and fall in moving
from one tone to another in a scale of such
tones---say, from the 1 tone up to the 5, then
down again to the 1. similarly, we don't hear
the harmony supporting that melody just depart
and return; we hear it depart and return by
moving from one chord to another in a scale of
such chords---say, from tonic to dominant and
back again to tonic. it is this exactness about
the space in which music moves that allows it
to be composed and encoded on a musical score,
even though the score itself is soundless and
motionless. it is also this exactness that allows
music to be analyzed and studied, rather than
merely heard and appreciated. and one way of
understanding the history of music, at least in
the west, is as a progress in such exactness and
that music happens in so articulable a space is
what seems to distinguishes it from mere sound,
which happens, by contrast, in time rather than
space. it is the space of music in this sense
that distinguishes it from mere sound, which by
contrast happens only in time.

between the so-called degrees of a melodic or
harmonic scale. (put the next bit later, to
suggest music is an illusion.)

so again, on the one hand, the motion we hear in
music would seem to be real enough to happen in
a completely accountable kind of space. yet on
the other hand, (motionless score; motionless
orchestra; and that space otherwise allows
for continuity of motion and identity through
time precluded by musical space; then maybe
mention hand, not following the motion but
supplying it, that music moves in moving us.)
other difficulties). . articulated kind of space.
(what do previous paragraphs show about the
reality of space.) the fact that music can be so
immediately distinguished from sound

and how could it be otherwise? after all, if
music happens in time, and time is a measure of
motion, then music, it would seem, is a motion
in turn; and for lovers of music, among the most
meaningful such motions in their lives.

(put weirdness below) space weird (symphony
seated in chairs), but real enough to involve
literacy, and what distinguishes music from mere
sound. (space differentiated enough to the music
not just in time, but in a kind of space. change
not just in time, but in space. the motion is
a form of *locomotion*, or motion from place
to place. but then again, time is not the only
measure of motion, at least if by "motion", we
mean *locomotion*, or a motion from place to
place. of motion in this sense, one measure is
time, but another is space. ---the space, for
example, in which a bird rises and falls in
flight. or the space, by seeming resemblance,
in which a melody rises and falls; and more
generally, in which music---at least of any
kind that involves not just beats but tones,
not just rhythm but melody and harmony---indeed
moves, from place to place, rising and falling,
departing and returning, very like the motion of
a bird in flight.

transition paragraph: mention that zuckerkandl
discusses this in sound and symbol even if not
in sense of music, and it strikes me as an
important issue, perhaps the most significant
issue, in understanding music, and its place in
the liberal arts. slavery and free. (make new
paragraph here: about how music also happens in
space as a movement; music is not simply change.
perhaps use motion picture paragraph to indicate
difference in the illusoriness of music and
illusoriness of motion pictures. organize replies
to evident illusoriness of motion in terms of
motion being an illusion, being an appearance,
and being a reality, in rough correspondence to
the distinction made in plato's sophist. also
mention music as a kind of liberal art.)

(rough organization: music as illusion, (and
being serious about music means being serious
about the possibility that it may be a waste
of time). but problem with difference between
illusion and appearance, such as difference
between movies and paintings. thus music
as appearance, but problem with unexamined
assumptions about motion. music as reality.)

(end with showing, how through compound ratio,
time is not simply one-dimensional, or even an
added dimension.)

but there may be less reason to accept this
conclusion than to deny it; and to wonder, then,
how meaningful music finally is. for the meaning
of music in this sense, upon reflection, would
seem to depend on the illusion of movement rather
than the reality of it, in something like the
way that a motion picture, despite its name,
only seems to move, being nothing in truth but
a series of photographs, or frames, on a strip
of plastic. music, too, may be nothing in truth
but the series of notes that we find indelibly
and immovably marked in a score. once these
notes are played in succession, just as once
those frames are shown in succession, they give
us the inescapable impression of something's
moving, even though nothing is moving. no frame
or note, after all, could be said to move itself
in the succession, or somehow fuse with the
next frame or note to render that succession a
genuine transition. yet we sense transition in
the succession all the same, in what is then a
mere image of motion, without a similarly moving
origin.

and the absence of actual motion in music would
seem still more radical, if we now *contrast* the
notes that compose it with the frames of a motion
picture. for those frames, at least in the usual
case, are of a scene in which the actors really
move, taken and projected rapidly enough to
reproduce that real motion upon a screen, so far
as the eye can tell. but there is no such scene
of real motion that the notes of music could be
said to record and reproduce for the ear. and
the scene of real motion closest to the music
we hear---the musicians playing it---is all but
motionless compared to the music being played,
as the players stay seated in their chairs, for
example, while the sound of beethoven's *eroica*
surges forth. indeed, it would seem necessary
for the notes in a piece of music to be *unlike*
the frames in a motion picture, if we are to
hear movement in their succession, at least the
movement we identify as music. for the succession
should not happen rapidly enough to blur the
distinction between notes, lest the music vanish
in a siren of noise; and the notes themselves
should refer only, or at least principally, to
one another in that succession, rather than to
any scene beyond, lest the music vanish again, in
a kind of picture-painting.

and even this much analysis of the difference
between our sense of motion generally and our
sense of motion in music depends on our taking the
notes of music not simply as sounds, occupying
particular moments of time, but also as tones,
occupying particular places in space---in this
case, the places in space that allow us to say the
melody rises and falls. but what kind of places in
space are this? what kind of space is this? and
*where* is it? surely not where the singer of the
melody is, or as if the melody could rise and fall
in the same sky inhabited by the bird. but if the
space in which music moves is not the same space
in which we encounter motion otherwise, then why
credit our talk of the motion in music with any
but a metaphorical sense? it looks as if we are
speaking only metaphorically in saying that music
moves.-->

the melody of &#8220;Twinkle, Twinkle…&#8221;, which predates
the words by some forty years in a French song
called &#8220;Ah! vous dirai-je, Maman&#8221;. In a more
important strictness, what I call the beginning
of &#8220;Twinkle, Twinkle…&#8221; is really the second
&#8220;event&#8221; in the melody. The first is a repeating of
middle-C, within which we hear the repeating of
the one-tone. But is this first event a movement?
Does it involve a change of place? I thank John
Verdi for drawing my attention to this question
after the lecture. I think this is a movement,
and can even be said to involve a change of place,
but one that shows why the melody is temporal
rather than spatial. I say more about this in

<p>It could also be noted here, in
light of a previous note, that we hear the
repeating of the one-tone at the start of
&#8220;Twinkle, Twinkle…&#8221; in the same way: as a movement
from origin to goal, even though the origin and
goal in this case are the same. This already
suggests there is something fundamentally temporal
about our orientation in the perception of notes
in a musical context. For we would simply stay in
the same place (on the one-tone) except for the
repetition allowed by time, which distinguishes
the place at one moment from the place at a
subsequent moment, and allows the staying to be
the result of movement (in this case from the
one-tone to the one-tone). <a href="#fnref:6" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>

<p>I also suspect that the space we are
carried into so clearly and compellingly by tonal
music is what makes atonal music so off-putting
for first-time listeners; it doesn&#8217;t carry us (at
least at first) into any space. There is also a
question, then, about what allows atonal music to
make sense once a listener does grow accustomed to
it. If atonal music can carry us into a space in
which we hear it move, then is this a different
space from tonal music or not? I thank Sam

<p>As I mentioned in an earlier
note, another mark of the temporal identity
of a melody is the fact that a note can be
repeated in it (like at the beginning of &#8220;Twinkle,
Twinkle…&#8221;), and we hear a movement in this
repetition even though the place remains the
same (making the staying-in-place of the melody
event-like rather than inertia-like). This implies
that the places in a melody are not just defined
by the articulated space we know as a scale, but
also by the articulated time we know as beat,
meter, and rhythm. <a href="#fnref:9" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p>
