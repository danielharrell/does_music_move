There is a well-known problem in the philosophy
of music, aptly described by Victor Zuckerkandl as
follows: 
"In music, then,
there is nothing that can move, nothing in relation
to which anything can move; there is nothing but
tones---and they do not move; indeed, when they
actually begin moving [Zuckerkandl here is thinking
of a siren], the music vanishes. Under these circumstances,
how much sense does it make to speak of music as tonal
motion?" [^fn-1]

In my lecture I wish to address this question, in terms
that makes the most sense to me. I also take it to be a
problem beyond music.

the External World*, pp. 83--84.
