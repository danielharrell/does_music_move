Does Music Move?

We talk---and think---about music as if it 
moved, in an elementary and thoroughgoing sense.
This is the sense in which we might say, of a
rhythm, that it quickens and slows; or of a
melody, that it rises and falls; or of a harmony,
that it departs and returns.

Our talking this way about music has a point. For if we didn't
hear music move, would we hear music at all?
Without movement, music would seem no more than a
succession of sounds. But there is also a problem
with our talking this way, despite its point. And
it is this problem that I wish to discuss in my
lecture, explaining what I take the problem to be,
and why I take the problem to be important---even
for those of us with little interest in music.
